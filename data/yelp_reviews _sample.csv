J3nx8u-uRRejlfyP9KjFhQ,2012-06-06,8wQIoFapkegkC5fcVYg_Iw,1,"I can't believe I forgot to review this place. Oh yeah, that's right. I wanted to forget I had the horrible experience of coming here all together. Too bad that didn't work out.

I came here last summer as a favor to a friend (one of his friends was guest bartending). First we looked for parking; not too difficult being as no one else wants to go here. We decide to pull into the adjoining lot rather than street park and some guy runs across the street, insists he is the parking lot attendant, and that there is a fee to park (although there is no visible sign). I tell the guy that he must be crazy and how do we know he even works there. Long story short, my friend ends up giving him the money (he's afraid for his car's safety) and we meet up with his other friends and head in. 

It takes more than 10 minutes for them to check us in for happy hour although we're literally the only people in line (and there's like 5 of us). I think I stayed for about 30 minutes to help out before I begged my friend to get us the heck out of there.

I went for the cheap Happy Hour and left scarred for life. Never again.",Positive

It was 9 am on a Saturday morning and the restaurant was about half full, so we were seated promptly. Right upon being seated the waitress greeted us and began reading the daily specials, which are also written on a large board in the back of the restaurant. 

They menu is quite expansive and they offer breakfast, lunch, and dinner options all day long. They also offer mimosas and bloody mary's for just $2.99, what a deal!

I ordered the crab cake eggs benedict with hash browns and my friend ordered the spicy honey chicken biscuit and a side of hash browns with cheese. Both entrees came out quick and piping hot. The eggs benedict were good overall, but the crab cakes had a little bit too much of a fishy taste for my liking. I wish I would've gotten the regular eggs benedict instead. But I did like the hash browns, as they had a nice crisp. My friend really enjoyed her meal and we both left nice and full!

Lastly, I want to note that the service was superb. Our server was extremely friendly and we were checked on multiple times.

Overall, 4 stars for good food at a good price and excellent service!",Positive

There is quite a bit of indoor seating as well as seating on the patio outside, and (at least pre-pandemic) the vibe was energetic-but-quiet, making it a good place to get some reading or work done.

It had great flavor, and I am not talking about just salt. The tostones were big crisp, the yuca fries were nice and crisp, the sweet plantains were perfectly cooked, and the green beans still had a nice bite to them.

8HDj3edet7BSM3iI8xdQxQ,2018-11-01,eVaVSAE3qkEjD59eDaLpIg,1,"My roommate and I couldn't wait to move out. 


The leasing office team is friendly and all but overall just incompetent and unambitious. 

We had numerous problems with the management team. I would contact the leasing office with questions every once and awhile. Almost never would hear back from them. I would call multiple times to no avail leaving messages for essentially no one. When I confronted the office about this issue they just claimed my messages must have just slipped through the cracks. Every single time? Sure. 

Parking here is a nightmare. Parking is first come first served. There are maybe 1 or 2 spots for each apartment. It is safe to say the amount of parking spots needed is very inadequate. If you want guests over good luck finding parking. Most of the time I would have to park on the opposite end of the complex and walk all the way to my building. Not ideal for unloading your car. 

Back in July our AC wasn't working properly. I suspected something was up as it would constantly run and not actually cool down the apartment. It wasn't until the 3rd maintenance call that they finally decided to replace the HVAC. They gave us a portable AC unit until the new one could be installed. It took almost a month before they actually installed the new unit. Originally the earliest their contractor could do was roughly 2 weeks out. Those 2 weeks or so dragged by. I got a call saying they will install it the next day. No one showed. They call me that evening to apologize as an emergency came up and that they would be coming the following day. Also no one came. I called and left a very angry message. To my surprise they made a lowly maintenance worker install it himself the next day without the contractor. Meanwhile, I was oblivious as (of course) they never returned my call from the night before. 

Other times I would file maintenance requests and would specify certain times. They were horrible about showing up. One time I had to call THREE times just to force them to show up. Wasted hours of my time sitting around waiting. 

The apartments look nice but are ultimately tawdry. We had multiple problems. Pipes leaking that had to be fixed numerous times. Freezer would leak water inside the freezer itself so we always had ice everywhere. Rain water would leak into our apartment upstairs and would soak through into the room below. The list goes on. 

As soon as my roommate and I found a new place to live we submitted our written notice to vacate when our lease ends. A week went by and I had not heard anything from the office. I decided to pop by to make sure they were processing the notice. Not to my surprise, they lost our notice. We had to submit a new one. 

With all that being said there is incessant construction noise directly bordering the complex which will more or less continue for the next few years. It starts very early and goes until late. 

Do yourself a favor and find a better place.",Negative

So, in this fine night, me and my family went into the Uno, and were seated immediately. That is always good. The waitress then ordered our drinks, not 5 minutes later. We got our first round of drinks very quickly. I ordered the chips and guacamole as an appetizer, which too, came really fast. First complaint: the chips were a tad greasy.. One of them was like biting into liquid. (Only one though). That's understandable as they are made fresh to my understanding. My father drank down his pop very quickly, and asked our waitress for another. Here's where things got a bit bad. We waited 10 minutes and we were not even glanced at by the waitress, keep in mind this is the 10 minutes after my dad ordered his drink. He has still not received it. It was when the table next to us got their 3rd round of drinks that my dad had to grab the waiters attention and ask yet again. Another 5 min and she came back with the drink. 

Other than that stuff, Uno has once again pleased me. I ordered the Fireball Whiskey BBQ Chicken Melt once again.

I was on my call at this point so it didn't really McMatter anymore, I needed to wait this out. At 3:33 pm, I finally made it to the 1st window (where the guy who took my order was standing). I paid him for my food, expecting a ""hey sorry for the wait"" or ""this one is on us because you could have gotten the people from Guinness book here by now to give you an award for experiencing the exact opposite of fast food"" but he was silent. Cheerfully smiling, but silent. 

I drive up to the 2nd window where you get your food and no one was there. I was starting to put 2 and 2 together here. This was the McHold Up ! While waiting at window number 2 I noticed my wife was at the counter along with about 6 other people all waiting for ""something"" too. She was looking for mayonnaise. Does anyone want to Mcbet if she got it or not ? The answer would be a resounding NO. Instead she got a ""I don't know where they keep it"" if you want to WAIT (another 25 minutes for your food) I can go to the basement and start opening jars until I find one that is white-ish looking. (sarcastic exaggeration intended here). 

So I finally am handed my McChicken sandwich (ok there were actually 2 of them) and my LARGE drink was served to me in a medium cup. I didn't notice till I pulled out but was thinking, I'm not pulling into that line again for a size difference in my cup.. lol..  I took a sip out of it, and you know that feeling you get when you're thirsty and take the first sip of a really good cup of soda ? Because if you do I'd love for you to Mcshare your experience with me ! Unfortunately I got orange colored seltzer water. Yep, not even worth the McWait.. but in the school of fairness my sandwiches were acceptable. That wouldn't be enough to pull this McPlane out of a tailspin. 

You get 1 McStar only because I can't go any lower. Oh did I forget to mention ? My wife interrupted a drug deal going down so felt safe enough because of the crowd (of people waiting) to move to the other side of the restaurant. Are you McFreaking kidding me ??",Positive

I had purchased a copy of their book (part history, part recipes) at an author event at the Free Library of Philadelphia, so I stopped in before auditions to get a couple donuts and taste what passed for coffee here.

I was not disappointed.

Fresh hot cookies and crème donuts were heavily sugared and initially too hot to eat, but once they cooled off, I appreciated their texture and flavor--everything I wanted in a donut.  The coffee was rich and flavorful.  A great start to my Saturday! Highly recommended.

I'm saving the fifth star for when I get to try the chicken next time I'm in the neighborhood.  I have used their recipe to prepare chicken at home, and it got rave reviews, both with bone-in and tenders, so I'm looking forward to my next visit to Federal Donuts.",Positive

When this place first opened, I couldn't wait to try it because it looks like such a good place. Don't let the atmosphere fool you, I've never been more disappointed. 

First of all, the price point is way high- even for downtown, it's just way too high. We're talking $20 for a small ""speciality"" pizza that comes out with toppings from a frozen $1 Mini pizza. The crust was absolutely horrible. Imagine crappy mass produced toppings on a saltine cracker and this pizza tastes worse than that would. 

We ordered some pricey cheese sticks as well. Yet again, frozen and mass produced, and not even cooked all the way through. I mean, if you're  going to charge people a premium price for frozen cheese the least you could do it cook it through, idiots.

I called the next day to say I just wasn't happy with it and the god awful manager had been waiting for my call. They knew they had done a bad job and were literally waiting for my complaint.

What was I supposed to do? I went back in to get it fixed but the same guy turned it into the most god awful dishwater dirty mousey blond. I told him it was mousey and he started getting super rude telling me I was wrong. I sat in his chair crying for a couple minutes then paid my extra money and left. Had to get it fixed somewhere else.

As with many nail salons they always ask if you want gel, tell you it's better- I always explain it doesn't really last longer for me and my nails grow fast and I don't want to pay the extra, but I wish they would remember me and stop asking every time. Other than that, the place does a great job and I will continue to give them my business when I'm in the area.",Positive

I decided to give it a shot since it was conveniently nearby. This was my first time going here and it's located in a medical office with a parking lot in the back. Plenty of parking available. Location is right off Bayshore.

My laser hair removal technician was Jessica and she was super nice and professional. The hair removal process was completely painless. I had laser hair removal before and it felt like rubber bands snapping at my skin. But the machine that Jessica used on me was nothing like that at all. I just felt slight pulling at the hairs and some warmth. I definitely prefer this process/technology over other types of hair removal since it's so painless and I don't need to take any pain meds beforehand (I'm a wimp to pain!)

I totally recommend this place if you're not a fan of waxing/painful laser hair removal process!",Positive

How when you're open till midnight? dont bother placing a to go order because the rude heifa that picks up the phone will hang up on you like she can't be bothered to do her job. I really don't understand how this place is still in business. Dined there before and was going to give it another try because the food wasn't half bad and they're open late .

Similar to other stories below, David Haak took my substantial deposit to build two sets of bunkbeds in August and went radio silent in November.  Since then his website has been taken down, he doesn't respond to emails and all the phone numbers I could find for him have been disconnected.

In short, do not order from him, you will lose you money.   I have sympathy for David's personal situation, but he appears to have been taking deposits on new orders well after he had stopped working on old orders.

For those who lost deposits, the State of Arizona has an online consumer fraud complaint form that is pretty easy to fill out.  If they get enough complaints, it might help them to go after David and Haak Designs.  The complaint form is at https://www.azag.gov/complaints/consumer  .",Neutral

Started out with the pork mini-kebob appetizer.  You get two with an order and can also choose chicken but you can't mix and match.  They came with pita and tatziki sauce. The pork was juicy and had a good charred taste.  The pita and tatziki was as expected. 

For the main dish, decided to try the youvarlakia soup.  This included a healthy portion of Greek meatballs made from beef, rice and Greek spices in a tomato broth instead of the traditional egg lemon sauce. It was very tasty and a huge amount of food with the pita, salad, green beans, and potatoes that came with the dinner.

Sadly, the same CANNOT be said for their Philly location. I will just start at the top and work my way down to the the last and worst incident...
1. Our room was not throughly cleaned between guests. Sticky tables, mirror was smeared and the bathroom crevices are filthy.$
2. Our room was not properly stocked with essentials
3. We stayed 4 days, 3 nights - our room was only cleaned once and no, we didn't stay in the room all day. We were out all day everyday at rugby tournaments.
4. The AC doesn't work so instead of fixing it the repair guy, I swear to god, brought us a box fan. Looks like something you would see in a warehouse.
5. They couldn't keep the elevators working - AT ALL
Long waits which resulted in 10 or more people being crowded into a single elevator.
FiINALLY
6. The wait staff, all but one woman, was horrible. The hostess being the most hate filled person I have come a across in a long time. I won't say this place hates peoples of non-color but I will provide you with an example. We sat at our table for several maybe ten minutes and no one spoke to us. No hi, no drink orders no nothing. Finally, I resulted to asking a waitress from the previous day to get us beverages (the only decent human working there today). She happily took our order and then told the hostess and our actual waitress. None of them bothered to come over and as a result she got our drinks. That was the last time we spoke to another employee until the end. Not the last time someone came to our table though. As a matter fact, the hostess came by but only to show extreme frustration with us b/c our 2 year old spilled cream on the floor. She actually leaned on our table with non cleansed hands and used a napkin to foot clean the spill!!!! Now, you might be thinking well that's just bad service, has nothing to do with skin color BUT EVERY SINGLE TABLE around us was greeted, offered drinks and repeatedly checked on. While we sat at our table INVISIBLE. We were literally the ONLY Caucasian family in the entire place. So, I will let you, the reviewer of this post, make up your own mind. I did actually point this out right as we were leaving and was threatened with actual violence by the hostesses friends.

bROJqwiTOnfaKi6GwExsTw,2020-01-20,axFKFNmqd0ZDe65wVmpLnw,5,"Unplanned one Sunday, I found myself in Haddonfield NJ. I had no familiarity with Haddonfield, but was totally impressed with the town. It was blocks of specialty shops, coffee shops, and restaurants. A very artsy, classy vibe. 

We wanted to get dinner before leaving town, and my wife and I were thinking Italian. I saw many other kinds of restaurants in town from Thai to Mexican. 

We settled on Mare Monte. 

On Sunday afternoon at 3:30pm, the place was basically empty, but I could picture a busy room on a weekend night. As it grew later into Sunday, more people were coming in. 

The waiter sat us by the window and gave us menus and waters. He came back with bread, olive oil and the specials.

I didn't see a drink menu and began to fret that Mare Monte was a BYOB restaurant.

After talking with the waiter, he confirmed it was BYOB. I was disappointed because I was planning to have a glass of wine with dinner. They don't sell wine there, but the waiter told me he might be able to help. He was able to get 2 glasses of red for me and my wife. 

The meal itself, was nothing short of extraordinary. We started with Polpo, ($14.95) which was grilled octopus over a bed of beans and corn. The octopus was warm and the veggies cold and it was pretty delicious. 

We followed with 2 Caesar salads. 

For my entree, I went with Pappardelle al Polpa Di Granchio ($23), a homemade pasta with crab in light cream sauce. My wife went with Fra Diavolo ($27).
The homemade pappardelle was outstanding and my wife's Fra Diavolo was equally as good. 

We finished up with a Tiramisu, coffee and espresso. 

It's highly doubtful I'll ever be back in Haddonfield NJ, but I'm glad I got to eat at Mare Monte. I don't think my wife and I will have that good a 3 course meal, for a hundred bucks, ever again.",Positive

He stopped by and was blown away by the bouquet they put together for him! He told the woman what he was looking for and she custom-made two bouquets; one for me and one for my Mom. Both were vibrant, healthy, colorful and beautiful! He said he won't ever go anywhere else for flowers again!

Since then, he returned for another bouquet for my birthday! It was a beautiful fall arrangement!

The flowers are fresh and last so long! 

The customer service is excellent and the prices are great considering how beautiful the flowers are! They even had an array of cards to choose from and did some beautiful hand lettering on the envelope for my birthday flowers!

I had high hopes for this place since i LOVE Cafe Ponte and On Swann restaurants. 

OLIVIA is quite new, just opened a week before. Located where the old Carmel restaurant used to be. There are parking spaces in the back and sides of the restaurant,  valet is also provided. 

The restaurant itself is quite nice, it's very esthetically pleasing to the eye. Loved the chairs, very comfortable. But wow, it was so loud! I seriously couldn't hear our server nor my friends. Our server was sweet but the service was slow, we had to wait a while to get our water refilled.

As for the food, we ordered the meat board, Prosciutto & Salumi. It was accompanied with pickled veggies, some sort of yummy jelly and 2 breadsticks. I didn't like how they separated the meat and cheese boards. While the meats were good, they need to serve more bread or crackers to help get salty flavor off our palates. 

Main entree, we opted for Chicken Milanese and Wagyu burger. It was ok, they didn't add anything out of the ordinary to make those entrees pop. I could've easily had that burger at any burger joint. 

Overall, the meal was a letdown. Sadly, there was nothing memorable about the dinner.",Positive

I have been searching for a good Mai tai since Honolulu. Yay, finally found one that compares. The Chinese meatballs were delicious, and so were the crazy Asian rolls. My sashimi entree was the chef's choice  and I was not disappointed.

Pulled pork sammie made me burn 
Cool visceral vibe 

Talk about nick of time. We got there just in time to be able to switch from a tiny two top, to a much cozier booth just before the bus pulled up and filled N. 3rd to the gills...well, no bus was seen, but it filled up quick. Be warned, I don't think this is a random occurrence. :) 

I love the look of this place. Low lit, exposed brick, adorned by an eclectic array of art that runs the gamut from nude paintings of varied talent to small mixed media pieces. 

There really wasn't anything on the menu I wasn't interested in trying and in the end I settled on the pulled pork spare rib sandwich with horseradish sauce. While incredibly delicious it did give me the worst heartburn ever (I realize this is hard to lay at the feet of the sandwich, but all I can say is I rarely get heartburn...) 

Service was polite and attentive. Nothing stood out extra special or glaringly wrong, which is in my opinion the text book definition of how service should be.

Then you smell all the candles and pick a couple of your favorite smells, don't worry, the employees will help you decide on pairing them together and let you smell the bottles together before you mix. Mix and stir the oils together, pour in the diffuser bottle and your done. Took about 20 mins from start to finish!

WU9gEiAjHOmksD6j9HTfWQ,2013-11-07,xtSQ1I4_x7XT90Nqsik5Mw,1,"DO NOT use this company... the company is a major CHEATER!!!
I had to put a star to proceed with this evaluation and they don't even deserve a single star! But I had to put something to proceed.

And NO, I did not get paid to offer my experience... this is true and real story... so it goes...

I started using this company 3 years ago. It started ok and price of oil is slightly cheaper than other companies. Than year to year, I noticed the total oil consumption keep going up regardless of how cold the season is. Finally, last year, I realized that there is an increase of about 300 gallons from previous year and the winter was not that cold. We didn't suspect that our oil company would cheat on us, we thought it was tank leaks or someone stealing oil. We pressure test the tank and also ask the neighbors if there's any suspicious people and possible oil lost due to stealing. The tank is fine. The neighbors told us they never heard of oil stealing (and one of the neighbors was a cop)... although we can't be absolutely sure. With the investigation over the summer and the precaution we took to continue the validation, we decided to change to another oil company that will give us a printed receipt for every refill... as Reno Fuel Company only provide a written note on each refill. 

Finally Reno Fuel Company proof that they have been a thief all these while... They decided to send us a receipt of a 100 gallons refill in Oct 2013, but we already fill the tank with another company. Which means, they did not put in any oil in our tank and attempt to charge us $400+. We confronted ""Dave"" on the phone, he did not defend himself  when we accuse him for robbing us, instead he said ""he does not need our business anyway"". The final statement he made that confirmed he is a BIG BIG lier and cheater is when he told my husband that my husband's father instructed the refill... guess what, my husband's father has passed on for more than 15 years! 

Reno Fuel Company, DAVE... u are a big joke and you don't deserve to be in business!!!",Negative

Parking was very convenient. I had to drag a rolling bag with me (for my equipment) and didn't have to go up or down any stairs; that's a BIG plus!

[Nerdy Photography termini logy and concepts start here]

The field itself was AstroTurf. Lighting is very directional towards the home plate area. The lighting just above the center field wall really drops off.  On the best part of the field, 1/1000 iso2500 f/2.8. On the less optimal parts, it would go as low as 1/640 iso3200 f/2.8. Sort of tricky depending on which way you are facing. The stands were a solid 1/500 f/2.8 (I can't remember the ISO, but I guess it would be around the 2500-3200). One nitpick was that the white balance was tricky. It's in the neighborhood of +/- 4000K. Because of all the LED lights, there were risks of strange color casts mixed in. If you figure it all out, feel free to share; especially if it changes!

We ordered the seafood soup, black mushrooms with bok choy, and the beef with long hot peppers.  Upon check in, we also utilized the offer to get a free order of dumplings in hot chili oil.
The seafood soup was good, a bit bland tho.  I used some of the hot oil from the dumplings and it made the soup close to perfect.  As far as seafood content, there was only bits of shrimp in there- so don't go in expecting a plentiful portion of seafood.
The dumplings were as to be expected.  They were big and filling-I only ended up eating one because I didn't want to fill up.
The black mushrooms and bok choy was good.  Served in a white sauce, there was little flavor involved other than that of the mushrooms and the bok choy.  Again, the chili oil came to the rescue.
The shredded beef with long hots was delicious.  The beef had a nice, smokey flavor, and the dish was cooked perfectly.

   a) The polenta fries have a serious kick to them. 
   b)  Order the Mel's with mayo, because it's dry. 
   c) The crazyasspancakes with Butterfingers or whatever they have that day will be great for about 5 bites. And then it's just too sweet.   
    d) Ditto the French toast.  
    e) The secret is for one of you to order something normal (burger, veggie sandwich, cali Turkey)  and the other to order the crazy and then split it. 
     f)  The fries are OK, but you're better off with breakfast potatoes or polenta fries.  Or fruit.

I remember they had signs up in retaliation to the ""Law"" that Ruth Anne Minner had signed.  Thank God.  I think my Structure shirt from1998 still reaks of smoke.  
              Anyway, this place is a pit, but I kinda like it.  It smells like uncleaned bar,  (hey, maybe the smoke wasn't that bad...), and is the most generic bar in North Wilm, located in a crappy stripmall on 202, but I've had some good times there.   Years ago when I was a restaurant worker at John Harvards in the late 1990s and early 2000s, this was a great place to grab some beers after work, and they used to get a pretty good crowd of in the biz people.  Now I usually don't shut the place down, so I am not sure if they get that crowded late, but I do enjoy free pool on Tuesdays once or twice a year.  Staff has always been cool, and beer selection aint too bad either.
                 I remember back in the day the jukebox used to be ours with $10 carrying us through enough games to last the night.  Some of the old farts at the bar used to get really pissed with us when I'd play back to back to back to back  Deacon Blues by Steely Dan, but F'em, what kind of beer are we drinkin?

YSRM9nWQn40eg49tSiI-_Q,2017-02-20,WdezEW3GjYnCeOmTCxX1TA,3,"At the recommendation of the ""internet"", I decided to give Mi Nidito a try. It gets a lot of hype for its having hosted President Bill Clinton, among other celebrities. So when we learned of the 1 hour wait on a Saturday night upon our arrival, we weren't surprised. Good food often requires a wait...

Unfortunately, however, I can't say Mi Nidito was worth it. I've been twice now and both times have had at least a 45 min wait and the staff was all rather short and unplesant. The salsa was good (though too spicy for my tastes and I have a decent spice tolerance) but I'd prefer it a bit chunkier (It seems more like a chile sauce...completely smooth and somewhat runny). 

On my first visit, I had the President's special. While nothing on my plate was bad, nothing was particularly noteworthy either. The tostada was probably the best part of the special. The price was fair for the amount of food (just over $15), but everything was rather one-note and I don't really understand the mounds of shredded iceburg lettuce on the plate. 

On my most recent visit, I had the beef tacos and they were odd to say the least. The beef was cooked almost like a burger patty then inserted into a hard shell corn tortilla and topped with lettuce, shredded cheese and queso fresco. The beef was very greasy, didnt have a lot of flavor, and again it was odd having a beef patty in a taco shell. I didn't care for them.

Overall, I can't say Mi Nidito meets the high mark set by Tucson Mexican food. 2.5 stars.",Positive

It would be nice it they did only that, but the owner who started this business after getting out of prison apparently has yet not learned that we should not scam people. As i said, they fixed my buick pretty nice, however the owner tried to scam me delivering a chinese piece of junk that he bought for $50 while i ordered an american brand that costs $130. Once I told him I didn't want that chinese rear view mirror, he threatened to beat me inside his store and I called the cops which came and said theycouldn't do nothing since it was a Civil, not criminal matter. Luckily I had paid through Acima Credit, explained them the situation and they've refunded me the difference. I'm glad I had to finance it, otherwise he would've had his way, as he probably always does with unaware clients.

My point is: If you need your car fixed, go to this place. The employees are very good decent people and know they way around autos, but DO NOT trust the owner with buying your parts (specially wheels, smart rear view mirrors, etc), he is gonna get a knocokoff brand from china and sell it to you thinking you won't notice and if you notice and confront him he will threaten you in his office and the cops won't do shit. I guess it's my fault for trusting a mechanic, because of the likes of him mechanics are not trusted and I won't ever trust one again.

 As I told him face to face when it happened, i wasn't even mad for what he did, business is business, he tried to get a fast 95$ not a problem, but i noticed so he lost the bet, this is life. My only problem with the situation was he threatening me and not wanting to refund that chinese piece of garbage. It's actually sad that he decided to lose a good client (and possible friend since we were even talking about fishing). Good thing he showed his true colors though, I have no business with this kind of people.",Positive

My wife ordered tea, cannelloni, and I ordered a mushroom pizza.  The tea was almost transparent. Basically no flavor and disappointing. Honestly never seen anything like it. They can not even make tea correctly... 

My wife's  meal came with a ""salad"" this was literally just cheap salad mix from a bag and Kraft ranch dressing. No cheese or any other items. They literally just opened up a bag of salad mix and put it on a plate. Disappointing! 

My pizza was overcooked and looked terrible. This place also uses CANNED mushrooms on pizza. Who in the world uses CANNED mushrooms on a pizza. Needless to say I had one piece and was done. The waitress also lied to me and said the mushrooms on the pizza were not from a can. Please lady, it is pathetic to think you can lie to customers and get away with it. Canned mushrooms on a pizza! good lord what do mushrooms cost 1 dollar?!?! 

My wife's Cannelloni was basically rubberized microwaved noodles. We sat next to the kitchen door and literally heard the lady put the Cannelloni in the microwave. Clearly they just make a big batch, freeze them, then microwave them. Actually, I am not even going to give this place the benefit of the doubt that they actually make their own cannelloni. Probably bought from restaurant depot. 

The waitress made no attempt to literally do anything. You would think that if someone eats one piece of pizza you would at least ask what was wrong with the food. She clearly did not care at all. Asked if I wanted a box. Lady are you kidding me?!?! Your one table eats non of the food you serve them and you do not even ask any questions except for ""Do you want a box"" 

NO was my answer. What a joke. Literally I have never in my life left an entire Pizza at a place. 

The Hill has so many fantastic places to eat at but this IS NOT ONE OF THEM. Please do yourself a favor and literally go to any other establishment in the surrounding area. 

PATHETIC!",Negative
AZ42H2kk4JUiskC9NPoUjw,2017-10-03,mBkxVHscXkdx278D_gCZDg,4,If you're looking for something fancy...this ain't it. But if you want some good southern food or a hangover cure stop in this place. My only issue was there wasn't any menu prices. I kinda get the feeling depending on whose ordering (local or tourist) or what day of the week it is they'll charge you whatever they want because there are no prices on the menu. The good news is that it's worth it. I had a shrimp platter and the shrimp was falling off the plate because there were so many. My boyfriend had a fried pork chop with rustic potatoes on the side. He loved both especially the potatoes. All in all a great hole in the wall spot. Especially if it's close to where you are staying. Check it out you won't be disappointed.,Positive

I'm glad we didn't, because it was probably my favorite meal of the trip. Went around dinner time (6-7PM) and there was a massive line already formed outside of the building. I'm assuming there is a pretty long wait at all times, as we have noticed there is quite a wait time for anywhere ""popular"" in this city.
Made friends in line, everyone seemed to be coming from elsewhere. The bartender walked outside down the long, never ending line asking if there was a party of two. Luckily, my boyfriend and I were just that, and she pulled us up and we were able to sit at the bar. It was honestly wild that out of probably about 50-75 people we were the only party of two but I was not complaining! We were starving! So we waved and laughed at our newly made friends and promptly sat. 
I ordered a platter (half rack of ribs, 6oz of brisket, with three sides-I chose mac and cheese, greens and cornbread obviously!) The ribs were fantastic, the best ribs I've probably ever had-although I haven't had ribs many times. They fell straight off the bone before my teeth even sunk in. The sides were all on point as well. The brisket was pretty good, could have been more juicy. I thought my portion was a little dry. The beer selection was also good, they had quite the selection of crafts on tap. 
The bartenders were working hard-I watched them deal with tons of difficult, awful creatures. I give them credit where it's due. Hooked up their tip, partially because they pulled us from the awful line and also because they were nice! 
We were leaving after our meal and our friends in line finally were getting to order their food. (Yikes) It was probably over an hour wait. Worth it!! Go here!!",Positive

We couldn't find goat cheese under cheese, but he told us where to go to get it.  He made a few recommendations too.

odqgXlLcuedUMyD8Aetwfg,2010-01-29,oQUyojSOb6rdMnusw0M5lg,1,"Worst. Service. Ever.

I usually find it silly when people write reviews for chain restaurants, because although a lot of times I get bad service when I go to them, I still go back because of a dish I crave or just need to have. This is definitely the case for this CPK. I want to preface this rant by saying that during my summer breaks from attending university, I work as a server at a restaurant at the same level as CPK. I consider myself laid back when I go out to eat, as long as you get me my drink and food without much fuss then I'm more than happy to tip 20%. If you're funny, definitely 20+%.

I met my friend here a few days after Christmas to catch up around 6:30. We only had to wait 15-20 minutes, and the hostesses were very sweet. When we were sat, we waited at least 10 minutes for our server to even acknowledge our existence. I order a soda (still 4 months away from 21) and my friend orders a simple draft beer. She comes back 5-10 minutes later saying their computers were crashing again and she apologized for the wait. I would be fine with this, however she didn't have our drinks. I know you have to use a computer to get most drinks from the bar, but she could've brought my soda and my friend a water, right? She takes our order without writing it down, which I know is a mistake from the get-go. I have one modification on my pizza.

To make a long story short, my order is run out by a food runner/other server and is not correct. He says the kitchen is making me a new one. Our server never comes to check for at least 15 minutes, though I see her standing around talking to the bartenders and in the kitchen. I don't get the pizza for another 15 minutes, totaling 30 minutes total. When I do get it, it's the same food runner/other server and this time it's still wrong. When I say that I didn't want bacon on it (that they decided to add for whatever reason) he responds with ""Well I'm not your server.""

Finally the server get the manager who was very nice, and got me a nice warm barbeque chicken pizza with onion and cheese and no cilantro. I devour it in 6 seconds. The waitress asks if I want another soda, she returns with Coke instead of Diet (not a big deal, I know, but at this point she was just annoying me.) The manager compted our bill, which I thought was a little drastic, but hey I'm not complaining!

THE WORST PART, though, was that the whole time I'm waiting for the second pizza, the server (Jamie, I believe was her name) kept coming up and saying it wasn't her fault, it was the kitchen, etc. Scrounging for a tip. I hate that. Hate it. We left her $5, I think due to guilt over the compted bill, but we should've left her $1.

Maybe it was post-holiday stress, but they need to get their act together. Food was delicious, though, as usual.",Positive

The Kimchi Bokeum and Kalbi dolsot bibim bap are 5  stars! :)

I have never been a fan of their sushi. While it isn't terrible, it just isn't the best in town. So I normally order off their Korean menu.  I used to come here a lot when I was in college. My go-to dish was always the Kalbi dolsot bibim bap (kalbi w/ veggies and rice, and hot sauce, served in a hot stone bowl that makes the rice crispy and semi burnt....which Asian people LOVE).

I have also tried their soon dubu chige, kimchi chige, sulong tang, chap che, dduk mandu guk, numerous times. I have ordered their Korean bbq as well. Those dishes are all decent...not as good as the ones you will find in Kali, but decent.  The kalbi dolsot bibim bap is still pretty darn good here....but today, I ordered the Kimchi Bokeum. Oh my! I'm a bit of a Korean food snob. I'm pretty picky because my mother-in-law is a VERY good cook.  Unfortunately, she lives it of town. She makes the quality of Korean food that you WISH restaurants could achieve! Every time she visits Korea, she always has hordes of friends and family that barely wait for her to unpack her bags before begging her to cook for them. Seriously...true story! That said, this dish is similar to hers, although she uses thick pork belly slices, plus it is not quite as spicy as hers (she makes some of the hottest kimchi out there). But basically it is pork belly that is thinly sliced and stir fried with kimchi, rice cakes, green onions, and a little bit of veggies. This dish is very rich due to the pork belly. It is a bit oily....just the way I like it. But if you hate fat, or are counting your calories, this probably isn't the dish for you.  But I love fat, and never count my calories tho, so this dish is perfect! The rice cakes even have some ""wok flavor"", a.k.a. slightly charred flavor. So delicious! You should definitely order this if you normally order the spicy pork (tejii bulgogi), or if you just want to try something new. :) it is my comfort food. :)

pFnoqSPstZKsnyeNBIeuZg,2017-01-26,VL12EhEdT4OWqGq0nIqkzw,4,"Angelo's is legit.

Stopped in here, grabbed a cold slice of pizzer and two sammiches.  Both sammies were of the Italian faction.  One is called Angelo's special, and the other is the Sicilian sub.  On the surface, they look the same.  However, the Sicilian is served betwixt Sicilian pizza dough sliced in half, while the other is on a hoagie roll.  Tough to say which one I like best because they both bring different textures to the table, literally.  I guess if you twisted my arm for an answer, I'd go with the Sicilian because of its unique bread.

As for the slice of pizza, it was very good.  The sauce was a little on the salty side, but still a great NY slice that would kill an freaking craving.

Oh, and our server was amazing.  Can't remember her name, but she was fun.",Positive

The six of us ate. With local beer and excellent fish options, we did not want. I had the grouper, done pan fried, and it was very good. Was expecting crazy fish fry doused in oil but this wasn't that. With a crisp cool beer this fish and sides went down swimmingly, and everyone was delighted.

4WdDY97x4GdMYtyk1KQMnw,2014-02-03,vKwoXHvV58QtXyI0KcVKKQ,3,"Friday was an early day at work for me, so I headed Uptown for some Vietnamese grub with my gal pals.  We decided to give Lilly's a try since none of us had been there.

The atmosphere at Lilly's is fine.  It's a bright and airy place, and it felt welcoming.  Upon arrival, my table was wobbly, but it was corrected promptly by the waitress.

Our waitress was efficient, and extremely friendly.  We never waited for drink refills and we were checked on appropriately.  

For an appetizer, we split the crab rangoon.  It was fantastic!!!  They add bacon to it, and well...everyone knows that bacon makes everything better.  There was a sweet dip to go with it, and it was a perfect compliment.

For my meal, I had the grilled chicken vermicelli bowl.  My review of this dish here is pretty much on par with my review of the same dish at Namese (a new Vietnamese place recently opened in Mid City).  While I thought this dish was good, I found it to be 1/2 the amount of food that I get at Tan Dinh, and not as good.  It was just o.k.  Had I not gotten an appetizer, I would've still been hungry.  For the same dish at Tan Dinh, I usually end up taking some home (unless I'm a total pig that day).

My two friends both got pho, and they seemed to like it just fine.  I didn't taste it though, so I can't comment on it.

If you're Uptown, and you're looking to have some Vietnamese, there's not a thing wrong with Lilly's.  I'd go there again.  BUT...if I have the time, and I want what I consider to be the best, I'm going to drive and extra 10 minutes and go to Tan Dinh.

I think bottom line is that I just love Tan Dinh.  In my opinion, other than going to other places on the Westbank, or traveling to New Orleans East, nothing else touches it (Except when it comes to service.  TD still needs to work on that.)",Positive

First you wait 2 hours to buy a ticket and then you have to wait at least 2 hours for each attraction. We finally bought VIP tickets and went through it without much wait. The best attraction was the tunnel of terror. The asylum was too touchy for my liking, there was an actor with a snake who kept going after my daughter she literally shoved the snake in her face and hair. My daughter freaked out. The interaction of this sort is what made the attraction, so if you don't like someone touching you hair, grabbing your ankles stay away from this attraction. The Mayflower Hall is a waste of time, they say there are ghosts in there but I'm skeptical. The dungeon  was OK.

Section 300 I believe were traditional bleachers

Nothing has been able to compare to my dear old Ptown yoga pad.  This is pretty darn close though.  I'm not big on going up 6 flights to a yoga studio, but the entry way is nice and stacked below are my pilates studio and my fav eyebrow waxer!  

This studio really has a great serenity about it, as many yoga studios should have.  There are two rooms.  I saw the small one, City Mouse, and it looks small, but wasn't a packed house.  I practiced in the larger studio, Studio Elephant, and it was really clean, new/ nice wood, just really well maintained.  The views are pretty great as well, not that i'm looking out during my practice.  Gazing....

The teachers do have an Anusara background, and I need a mixture of all types of yoga.  Taken one class w/ Zhenja, and she was really skillful about alignment, arm balances, inversions included.  My biggest pet peave is a class that takes you at a slow steady pace, but doesn't seem challenging.  Zhenja hit the spot for BOTH beginners and more advance practioners - and it is a fine balance.  I do really have those days where I need a Power Vinyasa or Astanga class, and others where I need to rebalance my alignment in Anusara (because this hurts or that hurts....or I don't feel like washing sweat out of my hair).  The best part about Zhenja's class is it really felt medicinal, body was warm throughout the class, was provided adjustments as needed.  

I really do like that they have 1 hour sessions, 1 hour 15 min. (which are hard to come by these days) and just a few 1.5 hours sprinkled in.  After work, i'm excused and the last thing I want to do is stumble out of a studio at 8pm of City Center to get home, so there are a plentiful of options for you.  

My next tries: Justicia and the intermediate weekend class

The filters:
- A filtered water fountain (again a must)
- changing rooms 
- restrooms
- well decorated
- clean
- no showers
- $7 yoga hour classes
- $20 for 3 class intro offer
- plenty of props
- friendly receptionist
- they charge a dollar more if you pay with CC (interesting concept yet sort of deceiving.)
- yoga hour- don't expect anything fancy, no inversions. Minimal arm balances.",Positive

Neck, legs, I didn't think I had an IT band issue... well I've got a whole bigger issue that the IT band is just a part of and he was explaining it. I've had multiple surgeries and I have MS. Which means I'm kinda a hot mess. He asks questions to get to the actual root of the issues. Not rushed at all. He was able to release some horribly tight muscles and some of the tension I've been carrying for months. I'm not into the whale songs and chirping birds and he put on a cool mix that was perfect. He obviously cares about what he is doing. I was feeling chatty and so he was cool about talking which was cool. The location is a little strange at first.

I was hesitant to spend that on an old computer, but he talked me into it.  That seemed high.  Believe me, we own our own business and nobody makes $100/hour, so I believe that's high to start with.  Then he calls me and adds $50 to that! Again, he talked me into it. When I went to pick it up (a long time after) they said I owed $450 plus tax! Wait, I already gave you $100.  Oh that's just for the diagnosis, that's not included.  Really? You said it was a deposit, now when I go to pick it up, the hard drive total is $550! Who would spend that on a 2008 computer? That's half of a new computer. It seems like bait and switch.  I don't like their integrity. The very unfriendly office gal is mouthing off that this lady doesn't want to pay what she's supposed to.... It's not weather I could afford it, it's the deception that I am upset about. He ended up discounting it to $399.  So I spent $499. I'm so disappointed, and am scared now that I trusted them with a source of all kinds of personal information that they kept for weeks. I pray I can trust them with that, but am unsure since they weren't honest up front about the whole deal. Buyer beware!",Negative

(One of the parking spots was mine).  I told an associate Tom (who was kind and helpful) the situation and asked if there's a way to check the camera to see if my car was hit.  He brought me to the manager on duty Kirk.
Kirk heard my situation and began to laugh.  We all walked to my car while Kirk was asking me if I was serious about what I saw.  We came to an understanding how car owners may not know when there car has been hit and I asked Kirk to check the cameras.  He was hesitant to do so but he ""did"".  He went into his office as I waited outside the customer service area for over 25 minutes.  I left my name, email, and phone number with an employee at customer service asking them to have Kirk give me a call back.  I have heard nothing.
Kirk was rude, ignorant, and sexist towards his employees and myself.  I watched how he treated his employees and was not impressed.  Pushing and shoving his way through people is not the way to gain clientele.  I was a frequent shopper at this giant and I will continue to boycott until I see something is done with Kirk or the attitude at this establishment.",Positive

I ordered a few maki rolls to share as an appetizer, and the rice was soggy and mushy. My niece would always eat unagi donburi, and she ate 1/3 of the bowl and gave up eating because she didn't like the taste of it. I ordered their sake donburi, and ordered the large with 16 slices of salmon - it came, and I feel like I got jipped. 16 slices of salmon for $35 equals to 16 slices of salmon that was smaller than 1""x1"" and it was paper thin. I would buy sushi grade salmon at home, and would be able to cut the fish like an actual sashimi slice. I'm speechless in the tiny slices of salmon sashimi for $35, and the menu said salmon and roe, but when I asked the waitress where the roe was... she said it doesn't come with it. It's definitely deceiving, and then after I told them it's not what the menu said and that is another reason I ordered it - she gave me a spoon of salmon roe. I honestly cannot say it was fresh, unfortunately. There was an after taste in the salmon roe. I've never experienced such an issue at any other Japanese restaurants. My aunt ordered the fish of the day, which was a Cod and it was so salty that she couldn't even finish it. The only good thing about this was the fact that my nephew had a great tamago maki there. Overall, the price for sushi doesn't equal to the quality and the amount that should be served.",Positive

The pizzas on Yelp looked fantastic! They have a crisp, golden and crispy look to them- Ours, not so much.

After a nasty experience at another restaurant, we were hungry and strolling around french quarter for a nice meal, when we spotted Oceana Grill with not a lot of people waiting on the sidewalk.. 

Tried our luck, and the hostess asked if we're okay sitting in the courtyard - Duh!  We're from New York, we'll take any opportunity to eat in an open space with fresh air :-D

Anyways, so right after we are seated, our server brings the menu, water etc... so 5-stars for service... And then while we're still discussing, he suggests we order their raw oysters right away... We did as told and then also ordered a platter of fried shrimp... 

Overall, great food and flavor, the oysters tasted fresh and great.

We had the Pecan pie with ice-cream for dessert, and nothing was left sticking on the plate (or its sides )

Overall, very pleasant experience and a highly recommended destination if you don't like standing in the queue for an oyster bar - I experienced that too, and can definitely say Oceana Grill is far superior in the quality of their product and service!",Positive
DjCCD8xRKAJmM_r-kB1jOA,2017-03-30,74kEEyuRna9O_J5HxxY9fQ,4,"War Memorial is where TPAC sends its less mainstream acts. The up and comers or those that maybe had their heyday last decade. What this means is you can see great bands and shows on the cheap in what amounts to a pretty good venue. Breaking Benjamin, Brand New, and the Flaming Lips are a few groups I've caught here. The venue reminds me of a very nice high school or community college auditorium. There is a large general admission standing room only floor surrounded by a wrap around balcony. The best seats in my opinion are the front balcony but really the size of the place means their are no bad seats. Acoustically it's small enough that a good rock band can really blow out your eardrums but a quieter performer can still put on a good show. It's not however perfect, The speakers are all to the front and on stage so you don't get the immersion of surround sound that larger venues with overheads and back of venue speakers have. And there can certainly be a rough concert in a gym sound to the place. Honestly if your band or theater act is playing here just go. It will be a good time. I'd recommend lyft to get here but there is parking downtown if you must drive. There is usually beer and alcohol served. A budlight will typically run you 8 dollars. The restroom situation is a bit of a hassle  they are in the basement and a bit hard to access if your in the balcony, at least you will burn off a few calories from the beer getting to them. Overall though this place rocks.",Positive

WG-uWu0xnqfYQbYe64n-Cw,2015-08-03,GBOOSbEqcvRqp5X5ZCEfEw,1,"This was our first experience and right from the beginning the staff was extremely hard to find. We noticed the games went by extremely quickly and the buttons on some of the games did not work and we ran out of time and it cost us tickets. I would also say that 20% of the games were turned off or ""out of order""

We then proceeded to play laser tag, which was really good. I would recommend that for sure. Very well done and a good time. Arena was a little small but overall it was good. 

The putt-putt was very cool as well. Short little 9 hole course and fun as long as you don't mind people climbing the rock wall to your side and kids zip lining over the course. 

After laser tag we went to the grill area to grab a few beers and some food. We noticed on the display sign that it said $2.00 bud light and Budweiser drafts. We went to order those and were told by the server that they don't carry those on draft, which makes absolutely no sense. That is also false advertisement. We then ordered chili cheese fries with bacon but were denied bacon and were told, ""we have bacon but not for that."" Our fries came out and were warm at best. The chili was awful, the fries were barely cooked and the cheese that was apparently ""homemade"" came straight out of a gas station type nacho cheese machine. Our server then disappeared for a few moments and then came back and told us that she ""had to step out for a while."" Aka she was taking a smoke break. (It must real overwhelming serving four tables at once.) 

We then went over to the ""18 and up area"" which I might add had 6 year olds running around that employees completely ignored. We attempted to play a game of darts but were denied due to a broken machine. We called over an attendant who then called over a manager, which took quite a while. The manager then went and handled another situation, while the attendant gave us a free game of billiards to play while we waited for him to get back to refund our money from the dart game.  We then put in our token for billiards and got everything ready for our game except for the fact that there was no cue ball in our table as well as two #10 balls. We waited for another group to finish and we borrowed their cue ball. We then started playing and mid way through our game we scratched the cue ball and it wouldn't come back out of the machine. We then searched for a manager once again which took 10 more minutes, which proves my point about them being under staffed. The staff knew their manager's incompetence as they were chuckling about our situations and how he was handling things. The manger finally came back and refunded our dart game and gave us another game of billiards. Also, 2/6 billiard tables were, you guessed it, out of order. 

We then attempted to bowl. We all asked for no bumpers but were given them anyways.  Mid way through our game they ran out of bowling balls. I had to physically walk to the back of the lane to ask the person in the back to fix it. Towards the end of the game our lane froze up. We waited around for an attendant but of course it took forever and we ended up walking away. 

After we bowled we went to check our balance on our play card at the kiosk but of course the machine was out of order. 

Safe to say this was a one and done type of place.",Positive

The service was fast and the food was great! They were really attentive to our girls and made sure we had everything we needed, without being over-bearing. Our glasses were never empty, and toward the end of the meal, they asked if we wanted a refill (yay!), instead of just pouring it in there - which always annoys me. 

The Beef Bulgogi my oldest had was the best I've had in a long time - I'm guilty of ""tasting"" it a few times. The Yakisoba for the youngest disappeared quickly, and she's picky! I had the Dduk Bok ki (spicy pan fried Korean rice cake and ramen noodle) and asked for it extra spicy. Ooh, it made my nose run - top notch in my book! - but was so good, I couldn't stop eating it! My husband had the Oh Jing Uh Bokeum (pan fried squid and veggies in a hot sauce), which was phenomenol. Squid is easy to over cook, but this was perfect!

QvHhFHrfLoRe-UbW4w_LPw,2008-05-30,5Fjs7GKqFu1Feg6-RufCuA,5,"For years Garland of Letters was just one of those stores that always was and never meant anything to me other than I liked the life-size lion sculpture in the entrance. It is one of those stores that has been able to survive on its own while the rest of the original South Street has been bulldozed to accommodate cheap jewelry and pocketbook stores and clothing lines sponsored by rap artists.

I finally went into Garland a few years ago when my interest in Eastern and native spiritualism peaked. The shelves are packed with literature, sacred texts and self help books on topics ranging from Hinduism, Buddhism, yoga practices, vegetarian and vegan cooking guides, Tarot and palm reading, Native American tradition, animal rights, holistic healing, and more.

The staff is both informative and witty and there is a wide array in incense for practice and home use, healing stones, and a case of beautiful jewelry and statues. Garland also hosts traditional yoga and other classes through the Skyy Foundation in the evenings. The classes are affordable and provide a learning environment unlike any gym style yoga studio the city has to offer.

Items in the shop are reasonable priced and you'll be able to find titles  Borders and Barnes and Noble could only wish for. Not only will you gain a sense of enlightenment but you'll also be supporting a notably worthy independent business.",Positive

Here are the issues though

They don't lock the front door. Major issue 

This is not run like a normal Goddard school. Any research says that kids under 2 should not have television watching time, yet they routinely have kids watching iPads. They strap the babies and toddlers into high chairs so staff can clean at the end of the day and have them watch movies instead of paying staff to clean after the children have left. This is supposed to be a school and watching the iPad is not why we pay tuition here. They also watch the iPad during the day as well. 

They make the toddlers take 3 hour naps, even if they don't need or want them! So 2 hours watching tv and 3 hour naps!  Is this really a school? Why are we paying Goddard School tuition rates?

You have to pack a lunch. At first this seems like a small issue but when you realize how much you're paying it really is inconvenient. They advertise fresh fruits and vegetables as snacks but rarely provide that- more like raisins and graham crackers. 

Overall like I said everyone is very nice but this is a daycare, not a school. It doesn't comply with Goddard School principles. If they actually ran it like a Goddard School, tightened up security, cut the tv time and provided lunch, they'd be busting at the seams.

tM7KPV5JwhsNThyxcrAeEQ,2017-03-10,JkzbBL4o0aSzpJ_XLMBwpg,3,"I have been coming to this theater for almost 8 years. This is the 3rd time it has changed hands since I have lived here. Muvico/Carmike did a great job renovating the place and making it a great place to go. Recently it has been purchased by AMC. I went to see John Wick 2 the other week and was gravely disappointed in what I saw. The place was disgusting, the floors/counters were not clean. Limited concessions, paper signs on the doors to the movies. It reminded me of the place the theater used to be before the renovations, a cheap movie place that you did not really want to be in. I am hoping that this will turn around over the next couple of months, and hoping this is just a lack of initial management. But, if the conditions do not improve I will have to find a new theater. Sad.

I have been back twice since my first review of the AMC owned theater. 

Likes:
The overall cleanliness seems to have improved and they have people cleaning the theaters after the shows. So I put down the initial dirtiness to the change in management. The only real ""dirty"" area I see is with the fountain drink area. It uses those new pick your own drink flavor type machines. The counters are always covered in pop and wrappers. But overall, the main counters, bathrooms and theaters have much improved. The concessions seem to have improved, I believe they have other items than popcorn and candy now, although I have not ordered any of it yet. So looks like the original disarray may have been from management turnover as I suspected. $7.75 ticket price for adults is nice. They also honor the annual refill bucket that people purchased when it was muvico.

Dislikes:
While not a major issue, seems kinda tacky, they still use paper signs on the walls to label the theater showings. Muvico gave you a plastic card to track points to get free drinks, tickets, etc. AMC has a Stubs program, you do not get card, you have to tell everyone your phone number every time (before) you buy tickets or concessions or you cannot get those points. Seems a little cheap not to give out the cards to me and more of a hassle.",Positive

I'm not a big shopper - i.e. just walk in a store and pick up whatever catches my eye - but I certainly have that problem here. My favorite part is their selection of international food! And candy, tea, coffee, the works. If you're a coffee drinker, sign up for their coffee rewards. Also, they have a nice selection of beer and you can make your own six pack of mix and match.

Apart from the food, this is also a nice place to find things for the house or gifts for someone else (just take a look at the bath/candle department). Everything here is reasonably priced and they always have sales going on. Another tip: Sign up for their Explorers reward program online before going and you'll receive a coupon!",Positive

I wanted to go spend my special day here and try something a different.  Plus I have been to Magggiano's in LA but Nashville has only one and this is it.   We waited about 15 minutes and Leo keeper us entertained at the bar while we waited.  Our server is Robert who is very good at what he does and you will not want for anything.  We had a delicious, fresh and  tasty Cesar salads. calamari, warm French bread with olive oil.  My main entrée 
Was Linguine Di Mare loaded with lobster, shrimp, mussels, and clams in a spicy tomato lobster sauce.  My hubby had Chefs KB's lobster Carbonara deliciously filled with Lobster, smoked bacon, Sugar Snap Peas. Smothered in a Truffle Creamy Sauce with spaghetti.  I finished my meal with a Cheese cake with Strawberries and a strawberry sauce topped with whip cream.  And of course I had some lemon lady fingers, complements from Robert for my birthday!  Love it!

K3fGTZ3lba5e8y06nxXXhw,2014-06-23,F_djTh3Y7mK0E25ag-lIUg,3,"Played this course the other day and overall quite happy. 

The pros; a very scenic course where you feel like you are in the Poconos. There are 3 holes in the middle of a neighborhood, other than that you are in the middle of the woods. In fact before you get to the first hole you need to ride about 5 minutes through hilly forests. It's pretty amazing this is lower bucks county which is pretty built up. It was well groomed with nice fairways and massive greens. I found it challenging in that there is not much room for error. Ponds, the Neshaminy Creek, vegatation are all things you need to navigate over. We did not stop in for a drink at the club house but it seemed nice. Equipped with a bar, television and pool table I am sorry we did not stay to check out what else it had to offer. 
The cons; the website tends to lead you to believe that you could play 18 especially when you look at the scorecard, but it's really 1-9 repeated. It's only 9 holes, which is fine but they charge you for a full 18, and tell you it's unlimited golf. There are two pins on each green in case you go around twice you have different holes to go to. So for what is a ultimately a 9 hole course it is a bit pricey. $36 for 9 holes at twilight. Also there were no maps at the beginning of each hole, so for a first timer on the course you feel like you are swinging blindly. 
Would still come back regardless of the price, but I think there are other places to go for 9 holes that are less expensive.",Positive

We weren't sure if the restaurant was still open because we saw the chairs were stacked on top of the tables (clue #1), but hubby asked anyway and was told that yes, they were still open. When we walked in, I noticed the yellow bucket and mop, and smelled the strong smell of bleach (clue #2). At that point we should have left but we were told to sit at any booth. We did and looked over the menu. We were asked what we would like to drink. We said water, which the server brought to the table. For the 3 minutes that we were seated there, we really tried to overcome the bleach smell, but we just couldn't do it. We told our server that we couldn't take the smell and had to leave.

We're just curious though...why start mopping the floor and stacking chairs if you're still OPEN for business and are expecting people to come in and eat?! Why not CLOSE for the day and THEN start cleaning? If they had waited another 40 minutes, this initial review would've been totally different.

She got the Froze and I got one of their fall specials which was super delicious and sweet but not overly sweet. She ordered the buffalo shrimp while I ordered the brunch sandwich which was super delicious. I definitely picked at some of her buffalo shrimp as well.

I am aware that buying a car is a option and I shouldn't be reminded by it when I want to get my car serviced. They never was going to sell me a car but now they are not going to get the service my car needs. 

I realize that one salesmen isn't an accurate representation of a company but he was my first contact with Jim Reed therefore he represented them to me.

I will now be looking to take my car to another shop.",Negative

Surprisingly enough, in the 5 or 6 times I've been here, I've never gotten anything to eat, but I've always left sloshed. Nice.

They do a really nice job on the margaritas. Be forewarned, they are ultra-tasty, but super dangerous. $30 a pitcher (which will fill about 6-7 glasses fruity lookin' margarita glasses) is kinda steep, but you'll be on your ass if you try to down one on your own.

Decor is really really cool (but you'd expect this from a Starr joint). Its like blinged out vegas style bikes everywhere. Its super bitchy that you can't sit at tables to drink, and they have a tiny ass bar which means this place is I-can't-breathe level packed on weekends. The help is what you'd expect out of a trendy east coast establishment - they are pricks when they are busy (otherwise, they can be cool). 

One point to not be missed - they have one of those old time photo booths in there that takes 4 crappy blank and white pictures on old polaroid film for $5 or something. Drink a bunch of margaritas...try to fit your whole group in the booth...it won't work...but try anyways...stick out your tounge and kiss some cheeks (or combine the two and lick some cheeks if you've had waaay too many margs)...I've never had a bad pic from one of these.",Positive

_bqwjNXAW_Li6c8suIwdBg,2014-04-24,GBAWeum6LlKvS3Szq3mK_A,5,"I absolutely love Rickshaw's. A friend brought me here about four years ago to try sushi and I have been hooked ever since. Their prices are reasonable and the food is divine. They have a great selection of appetizers that are covered under the All You Can Eat menu. Other places have too much rice and too little fish. Rickshaw's balances the fish to rice ratio perfectly. 

They have a wonderful variety of rolls to choose from. Though, I have to say that the Rickshaw II is my favorite. Each time I go, I order at least two Rickshaw II rolls. 

I have several friends who go with me when I want sushi, but they are not seafood fans. Both will order teriyaki chicken or other dishes that aren't sushi. They both claim that their teriyaki chicken is the best. 

The sushi chefs are very personal, so I highly recommend sitting at the bar. One afternoon, I was talking to several of them about the different sushi restaurants around town. They told me that several of their friends work at other well known places in Reno, but all of them come to Rickshaw's if they want sushi. That is something to ponder. :) 

The only thing I will caution you on is the wait time. Normally, they take a long time to serve you and bring you the bill. A meal at Rickshaw's can be an hour and a half to two hours. I am a patient person and the food is so good that I don't mind. I couldn't bare to take a star away for that. 

Unfortunately, I have now moved to Florida for my husband's job. We live in the Pensacola area not too far from the ocean. I have tried several sushi places, but none compare to Rickshaw's!

After finishing up, we figured we would stay for desert and ordered the dark choc bread pudding. The gelato was very good but the bread pudding was extremely dry. At first we didn't think much of it but after looking closer we noticed that there was mold on the bread pudding. After politely bringing this up to our server (who was great, absolutely not their fault) they brought it up to manager and the solution was taking it off our bill. That's it, the manager never came over, offered any other discount, nothing. We were extremely calm about it and courteous so that other people wouldn't hear and this is how it's handled.

Color me impressed.

Firstly, we were upgraded from a one bedroom two a 2 bedroom suite, presumably because they are doing remodeling on one wing of the hotel, but I'd like to fool myself into thinking it was because they did it for my birthday.  ;)

The main lobby was welcoming with a pool table, a foosball table and a ping pong ball table. I saw a BBQ grill, a miniature golf set and a large scale chess set outside by the heated pool and whirlpool.  The employees at the front desk could NOT have been any friendlier or more helpful.  There was also a small convenience store off of the lobby, I didn't venture in, but I assume it was basic foods and snack items.

Our room was beautiful and extremely well decorated, with every amenity that we could need, including a fully functional kitchen including a full fridge, a coffee maker and coffee, dishes, pot and pans, blender, microwave, a two burner stove and a toaster.  (The kitchen even had dish soap and a box of laundry soap for the FREE washers and dryers on the property!)  

The suite had 2 bathrooms, each with a Jacuzzi tub, and the bedrooms each had their own televisions, iPhone alarm clock/docking station, and extra bedding and pillows for the comfortable King sized beds.  The living room had another television set and a pull out memory foam sofa bed, and a dining room table with 4 chairs.  Our suite also had twin balconies and each of the three areas had its own air conditioner.  We had free parking, free cable and free WiFi.

JUGFenrDf7rX50LGGz4qBg,2017-09-03,bgvvp5Ed4K9NS3jENECChA,2,"Great program, but be cautious when choosing this child care center.

I was one of the first parents to put my kid in here for preschool around 2008 when it first opened.  

At first I loved this place.  The staff was kind, the parents were close and I felt a real sense of community for the first time since I moved to Blackwood in 2004. I loved how TLE offered ""Parents Night Out"" and Family Night at Bounce U.  At the time, most of the staff were college educated and I felt that my child was in the hands of very competent and caring people.  Fast forward to when my kid started elementary school and was there only for before and after care.  That is when I started to encounter some problems with the owner, Mr. Lee Handis.  It became very apparent to me that he did not know how to talk to people and was hyper focused on the bottom line.  On one occasion around the middle of June, he walked up to me with an attitude and told me that I owed money because the school year had ended and the rate increased for full time. That would have been a okay encounter if 1) I had previously been informed of the rate and 2) I had been approached with respect.  On another occasion, he asked to see my bank account, be he believed that I had not paid the month.  What he failed to realize is that I have paid ahead for the month on the 31st on the previous month.  What parent wants to share personal bank account information in order to have their child continue to attend. They also attempted to charge me more for using my credit card.  However, what one should realize is that it is illegal for a merchant to charge a client more money because they don't want to absorb the fees associated with using Visa and/or Mastercard.

Fast forward to 2017, I had my 3-year-old son enrolled for before and after care so that he could be transported to the preschool disabilities program in the school district while my husband and I worked. This is where the proverbial ""ish"" hit the fan. My son has a speech delay and tends to get aggressive when he cannot express himself. While I understand that can be a challenge, Mr. Lee did nothing to try to work with him in order to make the situation work. In fact, he monitored my son on the cameras and complained that he was causing the kids to run away from him.  Never did he mention that there was another kid that I personally seen up in my son's face and taunting him, which caused him to become aggressive. I only mentioned that because I personally witnessed it when I picked him up.   

Mr. Lee personally informed me that he didn't think that my son could attend there for full days and that he didn't want to charge me for my son to have a personal aide.  I paid $180 for his first week and Mr. Lee called me on day 2 around 5pm demanding to know when I was going to pick him up.  Day 3, my son had a good day.  Day 4, apparently, my son bit a kid.  Mr. Lee informed us that if it happened again, he would be out. 
On both the 4th and 5th day, I dropped my son off around 7:40am and he called us to inform he needed to be sent home because of his behavior problems.

Please know that if you have a child with special needs, the ADA act, IDEA act, and the NJ LAD laws makes it so that child care center have to at least make attempts to make the situation work.  I know for a fact that if my son was allowed some slight modifications, the program could have worked for him.  However, Mr. Lee did not even try.  He basically took our money, knowing that my kid was going to a program for being preschool disabled and gave us the message that he didn't think TLE was a good fit and that we need to find another daycare.  Please realize that that meant that a week before the Gloucester Township preschool disabilities program started, I had to scramble to find other child care arrangements.

Mr. Lee Handis, you have a great program on your hands, but you must learn some people skills and not be so focused on your bottomline.

I only give 2 stars because I think the franchise has a good program.",Positive

SDL247FlOnScJfuNjZESxg,2019-06-07,5kcLlhJPLJL_GLwrAdbZAA,3,"It's been a while since I wrote my first review so I thought I'd provide an update. I found myself here again because my friend Chris W wanted some American fare. I heard good things about one of their newer dishes, the Squid Ink Creste de Gallo and decided to give that a try. We had the Steak Tartare Toast to start. The minced filet meat was mixed with various colorful peppers and spices and almost resembled a Mexican dish in taste and appearance. We thoroughly enjoyed this take on steak tartare. My entrée dish reminded me of a dish I had in Spain with its pitch black squid ink pasta and large shrimp. The sauce was a hearty puttanesca with plenty of olives, capers, chunky tomato, and fresh garlic. It was delicious, however, I must admit that the shrimp were a tad overcooked. Chris had the Citrus and Rosemary Chicken Breast, which looked good, but the piece I had (an end piece) was overcooked and dry. The rest of it did look tender and juicy. Perhaps the only hiccup in our service was we were not offered bread like all of the other tables. It could've been because we ordered the Steak Tartare, but still...

Twenty Manning has always hovered between 3 and 4 stars for me. They do some things really well and then they hiccup on other things.

To my surprise my name is still around and he let me know that he can help me to get back in the water. My son found a snorkeling mask and the girl was helpful with his decision. Glad to see a friendly shop.,Positive

I say was because I am writing this during the Covid Pandemic of 2020 and I am in mourning for the loss of this amazing option.

But I was missing my Indian food fix and just had to go in for some lunch.  We had had dinner at another Indian place closer to home and it just hadn't hit the spot like Royal does.  I ordered up the Saag Paneer and was in heaven.  I could eat this every single day.  My wife My wife ordered the Biryani and it was great.  And I ordered the beef Naan as an app.  It was pretty darn good too.  Service was good as always.  Which can be hit and miss in some of the Indian places in town.  But Royal is definitely the best place for service in the last 10 years.

If I could rate this hotel ""1 star "" I would ! I am a titanium member who stays at mainly Marriott brand hotels over 100 days per year so I have corporate expectations as well as being extremely familiar in protocol. The young man who checked me on day one was wonderful ...he seemed very well and freshly  trained almost like he spoke as if he was reading a script (franchised location had only been open for approx 5 weeks) He thanked me for my loyalty etc. etc. explained my welcome points and then offered me the upgrade to the two bedroom due to my status and a complimentary bag of gourmet popcorn!  The next morning I went downstairs with the app opened and asked if an upgrade was available again if I were extend another night and it was a different young man and he said yes it was and I said can I book the AAA  ""lowest rate"" available and he said , ""sure the upgrade was available....""  then about an hour later I came downstairs with the room keys to re-key the cards and he said he had a problem and he had to wait for the manager to do the upgrade so we left to riverwalk for a few hours but James Bailey the manager went upstairs to the room when my husband and I were gone to QUOTE ON QUOTE Check a ""water leak ""   As he {without my permission } went through MY ROOM to search for an extra charge he could  tack on to make up the difference .... to get it closer to the amount they wanted for the 2 bedroom /$400 room.  I was supposedly being upgraded from the AAA rate of $150 -

I found out form my younger brother when we pulled into the parking lot all the shenanigans; unauthorized entering of my room; scare tactics; going on and OF COURSE I WENT STRAIGHT TO THE FRONT DESK AND DEMANDED TO MEET MY UNAUTHORIZED INTRUDER- James bailey (the manager ).. HE looked confused when I confronted him he was shaking/pupils HUGE/ jaw shivering / hand shaking and my brother was not with me but yet he kept saying your brother admitted it he smoking inside the hotel hallway ?!  It was not until I said ""I am not paying a fee for something  never happened"" that he said he was going to call the police -I said show me footage , he said he never actually physically saw him but that my brother came up to him and told him that he was smoking inside the hallway ??  He then said I don't care if you are a platinum member it doesn't mean you get special treatment and I specifically said I don't know why you're bringing that up and by the way -I'm a TITANIUM . It was such a Bizzarre conversation I told him to go ahead and please call the police if that's what he needed to do because he wasn't making sense AT ALL and at first he just picked up his cell phone and was playing with it not calling anyone 
I truly believe that he thought he would just add the fee to compensate for the rate I was charged because clearly the upgrade was part of ""special treatment"" I was not eligible for.  This location does not ethically handle the corporate protocol for Marriott with deceptive tactics of entering rooms and ""creating"" bogus accusations to add charges when they feel an ineligible upgrade is being extended. I have never in my whole life been treated so poorly, manipulated and humiliated. I have never in my whole life ever even touched a cigarette. They have some nerve and I hope people read this and AVOID this location!! NOT A REAL MARRIOTT BRAND",Positive

f-xTgL53Bd_zPsDTn1_37g,2014-02-22,tt8Jy4Ezplxa4QiOixtVdg,1,"Cine-Bist ""NO""

My boyfriend and I decided that we wanted to go somewhere new and exciting for a Friday date-night. When I want to go out in Tampa one of the first things I do is Google ""fun things to do on a Friday night in Tampa."" Cine-Bistro in Hyde Park came up and so we decided to go. Let me just preface my critique with the thought that it is pretty hard to impress me. I have been in food service for almost 8 years and I see things that your average patron doesn't see. The experience started out wonderfully. I booked my tickets on Fandango, was greeted well at the door, sat in the bar and had a few drinks and appetizers. The specialty cocktails were average, but definitely catered towards a much older crowd. There is a huge market in serving drinks to young women and this place has definitely missed the mark. One of my favorite foods is edamame and this place definitely did well with this appetizer. However, the menu said that the vegetable was topped with ""truffle salt."" That was not true. It was definitely table salt. Either way it was cooked pretty well. After a few drinks we went in to our movie. 

The server was a nice guy and took our order promptly. I was prepared for an amazing meal because I had just dropped $90 on my dinner order, which was as follows:
1. Large Popcorn
2. Popcorn Chicken
3. Two entrees: Shrimp Mac and Cheese and Herb Crusted Chicken. (As described in the menu with homemade gnocchi and butternut squash sauce.)
4. Chocolate cake with almond sauce, raspberry sauce, and moist cake

The food came out all at once, except they forgot the popcorn. The Popcorn chicken was served with actual popcorn and marinara sauce. I'm sorry. Who in their right mind eats chicken in marinara sauce? Absolutely disgusting. There were also chopsticks in the container with the popcorn chicken, but no sort of Asian flair on the dish. Also, the chicken was absolutely raw in side and tasted like it had been sitting on the food line for at least an hour.  Total Bust. 

My boyfriend devoured his Mac and Cheese, but he will honestly eat anything. My meal was absolutely horrific. The chicken was at least D grade, which is the same grade they feed prisoners and dogs. It was absolutely covered in salt, which I guess is the ""herb crusted."" The gnocchi was bland and not cooked properly. Finally, there was no butternut squash. And I paid $20 for this entrée. Side note: you HAVE to pay %18 gratuity to the server. So some guy made $20 off of my meal where all he had to do was take an order. He is on the same level as a Taco Bell employee and making 3 times as much. So, because the servers only take your order and do not come back to the table to check on you or refill your drink I had to leave the movie and take my disgusting dog food, I mean gourmet cuisine, to the bar to get fixed. The chef walked right by me and said absolutely nothing. He even told the server that was trying to help me that he was busy. Excuse me? I basically write your paycheck. I don't know what your credentials are but they need to be checked because this food is morbid. Finally, 10 minutes later, I get a manager and she acted like everything is totally my fault. I settle for a cheeseburger and head back to the movie. The burger comes out freezing and after everyone else has already eaten. Since I don't want to eat a cold burger in the dark I take it back and just tell the woman to take my dinner off of my check and I'll go to McDonalds on the way home. She comps the whole bill and brings me the receipt in the middle of the movie and very rudely says, ""I'm sorry you didn't enjoy yourself."" How about, ""I'm sorry that we charge you like Bern's Steakhouse and treat you like Taco Bell?!"" 

I figured I would eat the chocolate cake because who can screw up cake? Well, ladies and gentlemen, CineBistro can screw up chocolate cake. They charged me $12 for FROZEN DESSERT. I literally couldn't stomach it. I dropped $150 at this place and would have been WAY better off to go to dinner in SoHo and see a movie at a normal theater. Definitely not worth the trip or the money. Great concept, but poor execution.",Positive

Some friends and I stopped by for 1/2 price Tapas Tuesday and 1/2 price wine bottles and everything really was fantastic. Inside, Cafe Alma has a cozy and chic feel, albeit quite dark in there, but I really liked the vibe overall. Since we were there around sunset time, we decided to sit outside on the patio to enjoy the nice weather and people watch. 

We started off by sharing a bottle of Moscato, although I don't remember which kind we ordered, it was in fact a great bottle of wine. Also, per the server's recommendation, I ordered the pulled duck quesadilla for my first round. I was a little hesitant at first, considering I used to be a vegetarian for many years and certainly have never tried duck before, but since our server was literally raving about it, I decided to give it a go. It was really tasty and served with some type of spicy sour cream and fresh pico on the side.

Next I tried the papas almas and the crispy shrimp alma. Both are tossed in spicy chili aioli sauce, which is always a winner in my book. The shrimp were crispy, plentiful and delicious. The potatoes were decent but didn't seem to be cooked quite right.

By the time all was said and done, I walked out of there stuffed to the brim, happy with my experience and ready to go back again very soon! I'm particularly looking forward to going back for brunch or jazz music on a weekend",Positive

Had high expectations going in but left less than satisfied. First service was great and wine selection was outstanding. Had a great bottle of Mondavi Emblem Cab which was priced fairly. The shrimp cocktail was fair in my opinion. Lot of horseradish but nothing overly special. The BLT salad was outstanding as was the lobster bisque. The bisque was a $7 upcharge but was good. The major disappointment was the steak. My wife and I each had the 8oz filet one prepared rare and the other medium. They both came out cooked about the same and were only room temperature. It seemed they were pre cooked and kept warm. Each of our courses came out right after each other with no time in between to catch our breath or get ready for the next course. For the price did not feel I received the quality and will not return. Better steak elsewhere.,Positive

It is connected to Londonderry mall which is a nice convenience as I can stop for a bite,hit the library,or get done most of any other errands I could possibly need to do.

My favorite part of this store is the staff. Everybody you come across is friendly and eager to help and I have always been greeted by everybody that makes eye contact with me. Another thing I love is every staff member I come across is working. There is nothing more irritating to me then when I can't find something and there is not a person in sight then later you find them all congregating in an aisle talking about their weekend or some such other nonsense.

Like one of the other reviewers mentioned I find  this store is a little smaller then some of the other Save on Foods so you won't get the selection that you would at say the Namao location but there is still always lots of great sales going on.

Dear Hubby and I each had pizzas.  I don't think I've seen a pizza smaller than these except the cheap little frozen pizzas we had as kids.  The crust was thin and nothing special.

Dear Hubby had the Tennessean which was a barbeque chicken.  After having the one at Cool Springs Brewery earlier in the week, he was hoping for another good bbq pizza.  The flavor was okay but was lacking in sauce.  He had to request extra sauce.

I had the Pollo Diablo with the diablo sauce on the side.  It was okay.  Nothing to write home about.

Our two guests both had the blackened grouper sandwiches with the remoulade on the side.  It was fairly good.  The fish was slightly overcooked, especially to the liking of one of our guests.  The remoulade was not a traditional remoulade.  It was green and not the typical one that looks almost like 1000 Island Dressing.  This is the second place lately I've seen that had a greenish remoulade.  But it was a nice sauce.

They have a family friendly section that was full with lots of kids, but the bar area is large and far enough away that it doesn't feel like a kids restaurant. We started with the soft pretzel with came with mustards and cheese dips. We ordered the pork schnitzel and bratwurst, both were delicious. The portions are large and we had leftovers from both entrees. Lots of great beer choices. The service was great.

The patio is open and it was nice to sit outside even though it was overcast. We started with the baked brie & carmelized walnuts appetizer. Perfecly warm and spreadable brie with assorted crackers and slices of crisp apple.
My only complaint is that the walnuts were a bit burnt which made them bitter.

The Farmers Feast is huge portion of knockwurst, bratwurst and a large smoked pork chop accompanied by potato pancakes, braised red cabbage and saurkraut. If you haven't had your pork fix lately, this is the way to go.

With the appetizer, beef stroganoff soup, warm bread & butter and our entree we had more than our fill. Can you say Oink?

Next visit we are definitely trying the rouladen!",Positive

That fed 20 people, and they let us bring our own desserts, cookies and decorations. We were welcomed with amazing customer service, Kathy Frank and our server Kate made it so easy and accommodated our group better than any other place offered.

The ballroom was a huge space, totally exclusive to us with a gorgeous golf course view! Also, we were not bothered by any staff or country club members during our event, only our server gracefully assisted us. If I have another large event, it will be planned here again!

The Brussels sprouts were too spicy and greasy for our taste. At $9 for the little plate, I could have bought two bags at the grocery store and made my own much better. Margherita pizza was mostly salty sauce with a few teeny tiny leaves of basil ... so few, it should not even be listed as an ingredient. The ""amazing"" tres leches tiramisu was neither amazing nor bearing any resemblance to tres leches. It was a very weak version of tiramisu which was basically a small mason jar of whipped cream and vanilla fingers at the bottom with barely even a hint of espresso.  At $8, this is on the high-pricey side for any dessert, for which we were expecting to wowed but were seriously underwhelmed. Anyone who thinks this so-called ""tres leches tiramisu"" is ""amazing"" must've never had real tiramisu nor authentic tres leches. The seating outside lacks ambiance, and having to go into the bar to order outdoor service was awkwardly inconvenient, not to mention the total lack of hospitality by the bartender who clearly did not want to be taking food orders. He didn't smile, didn't tell me the total of the order before grabbing and running my credit card, offered no glass with bottle of coke (I specially asked if their soda was on tap and he said yes) ... when I asked for the glass he gave it to me but turned his back and ran off without putting ice in it, so then I had to get the attention of the other bartender to get ice ... and after returning my credit card, he offered not a word, let alone a thank you.  The table top was dirty; an employee actually stopped at the table for a brief second and swiped a piece of food off the table with a napkin. So I expected him to return to actually wipe it down, but he wasn't seen again. Our food was literally dropped on the run so we had to yell after the server for silverware and plates.  The heaters were turned on by someone right before we left ... it was a chilly evening and would have been nice to enjoy the warmth while we were actually eating. All that said, the young ladies at the hostess stand were extremely sweet and a server inside was also very kind in showing us the way to the patio.  But this is a one-and-done for us. I feel I threw away about $35 of the $45 dollars I spent tonight which could have been much more satisfying elsewhere.  It's a crappy feeling to throw away hard-earned money, especially when it's in effort to have a memorable experience for a special occasion.  The other reviewers who gave one or two stars were spot on with the exact same complaints as us... if you don't want to risk the disappointment, I recommend you don't waste your time and money.

I have a background in electrical - I phoned these people on a Thursday and gave them explicit details of the problem, the root cause and the EXACT work that I needed to be done at my residence. The lady told me their best guy could not be here until the following Friday. I was told they guy they would sending the following week had a small outdoor lighting job that morning and he would be here by 10:30AM. After 8 days, I heard nothing back from them for a confirmation the day before the appointment. I called to try and see if they were coming at 9:00 AM the day of the appointment. Nobody answered or picked up (seems like a VERY small company and hard to get a hold of) and I had to leave a message. About an hour later and 30min from when I was told they would be here, I get a call saying possibly around 1:00-1:30. I said hmm, I'm not sure that is enough time to take care of the all work needed and that it is very important we get this all done and done right today. They lady who does the scheduling (was the entire cause of the problem) told me that based upon the info I gave them last week, they were thinking its going to be some ""easy simple GFI fix"". I said it is not an easy fi', I was very shocked, as i was quite clear what the problems were, what my expectations were, and that the wires burned and I almost had a full blown fire in the wall. The way the GFI was run and set up in my house is a total mess and needs to be redone completely as there are big time problems. I had spoon fed her the problem and the solution when I made the appointment the previous week. I said (again) that your going to need to run new romex and separate the circuits and add two new breakers to the box and add GFI outlets in several places for starters and that your guy will be to be here for at least 1/2 a day. The lady on the phone now says DO YOU WANT ME TO CANCEL? She kept telling me I'm not an electrician and blah, blah blah.(She has no clue what I know or who I am) I'm like lady, I cant cancel. I have been waiting for 8 days, this is a serious problem, it was all explained to you, and now your coming late and risk not getting the job done today. I really needed someone to come here and fix the problem and not give me a hard time on the phone. She acted like she was doing me a favor just gave me a difficult time and tried to blame me for her inability to communicate with a customer.

RFIHFxmNH9dM0ouz2N8ZjQ,2016-07-28,2VZnwSnZBXzZq-S1FwglWw,1,"Me and three buddies drove across town to check this place out.  When we walked in, there was a man and woman behind the counter going back and forth over something, just talking amongst themselves. Neither one greeted us with a hello or even a nod of the head. 
     The setup is: you look at an overhead menu like a fast food restaurant. You order at the counter and pay before you get your meal.   I f#cking hate restaurants like this. 
     I'll tell you why:  If you have never been there before it takes a while to figure out what I want. With four guys at the counter, it can take forever.   
     Now how about the people that come in after us who have to wait for the four guys in front who don't know what they want to order?  If it was me waiting behind others I'd be irate. 
     When I go to a cafe, I want to sit, relax, look at a menu, converse with my buddies, discuss what we want to order and slowly decide.  Not feel pressured to hurry up and order because others are waiting.  How do I know if I want dessert?  So I have to order that too or go back and pay again?  And how does one tip in a place like this?  15-20%?  No way, not when I order my food like a fast-food restaurant.  And what about my drink?  When my beverage is empty do I have to go back up to the counter and beg for more?  Do I pay more? How does this work?
     Perhaps if the lady and man behind the counter weren't so busy talking amongst themselves and had been more inviting we would have stayed.  
     Quite honestly, we didn't even try the food. Maybe it's good, who the hell knows? Not us. I was standing there smack in front of the two of them waiting to be acknowledged.  We turned to walk out at which point she sarcastically yells, ""Thank you!""    
     Thank you?  Did you really scream that in that tone?  As if they were insulted that we walked out. 
     What kind of ""French themed"" cafe makes you stand in line?
     When this was the Checkerboard Cafe it was packed, you could hardly find a seat.  When we walked in this morning it was empty except for one table.  But they were far too busy to greet us. At least say hello, go over the menu with us, say F#CKING HELLO.

It's new and relatively nice in a great location, right on the West edge of Clayton in Ladue and parking is easy. 

They checked me in fairly fast and it was not crowded. The problem here is that I had a pretty bad cold/flu and waited over 90 minutes in a room to see a doctor. Casual laughter could be heard among the staff and there was no sense of ""Urgency."" There was no one else in the waiting room and few cars in front. The doctor gave a pretty standard diagnosis. While this is a good alternative to an ER, it took way to long for a non-busy clinic.

There is also NO PHARMACY which is a great feature of places like Total Access Urgent Care. I was very disappointed by the lack of care compared to Total Access and others like that.

PBSU9I3tGjtvYRbzpUMDuQ,2020-03-21,p4dqW1Ma8f5HsUhGGckVrg,1,"I have a lot of experience with this UPS store. We had a business in Arizona for many years and used this location for more than one box. Over the years, they have generally been dishonest in all services provided to us. Mail was not sorted on time and delivered to the box. Based on the postmark, it was often withheld for more than a week. This can be very damaging to a business and at times it cost us money as a result. Even time sensitive Express Mail packs were held up because they were too busy to tell us the truth in that the pack had been received and was ready for pickup. We had to wait an extra day and spend extra time chasing down the mail. Packages confirmed as delivered by the USPS were claimed not received on more than one occasion. When we questioned the owner about this, she became defensive and rude stating that their policy does not include a guarantee of any level of service, only to receive the mail. I do not believe she comprehends English. Eventually, it was necessary to cancel our boxes and go elsewhere. After doing so, she refused to forward the mail, even when we offered to pay all costs! It was necessary to complain to the USPS regarding the mishandling of our mail. The USPS told us we were not alone. Apparently there had been several complaints about this particular UPS store. In the end, we lost a lot of important mail. They simply did not do the appropriate thing and return mail to the sender when they refused to forward. We can only assume the mail was simply tossed into the trash. I sincerely hope this review helps someone who is considering doing business with this UPS store.

It's been a while, so we had no idea that D&J's had changed hands yet again about 14 months ago. It has taken a decided turn for the worse. The waitstaff, bartenders, and host(s) were as friendly as ever and the place looks largely the same as ever, but when the food comes out, be ready for a surprise and not a good one. 
We ordered two tomato medley salads with burrata, some ""truffled"" eggplant sticks, blackened redfish (my wife's entreé) and shrimp etouffeé (my entreé). The eggplant sticks came out first. They were terrible. Couldn't taste the eggplant and bits of the flavorless eggplant were tough and stringy inside the battleship hull armor batter and breading, which was gritty and completely unappealing. The ""black truffle"" was clearly truffle oil. I don't know how the chef could have thought this was edible. I sent it back. The tomato medley salads were edible, but barely. The mixed greens were hothouse grown, supermarket mesclun, with about as much flavor as rice paper. The tomatoes were basically flavorless as well, a mix of cheap supermarket tomatoes and cherry tomatoes. The balsamic dressing was overly sweet, like they used some cheap, out-of-the-bottle brand. 
The entreés were disastrous. My shrimp etouffeé was so salty that one small mouthful was enough to ""salt burn"" my mouth. I sent it back and did not replace it with something else, choosing to have some of my wife's blackened redfish. The redfish was edible, but only just. The fish was poorly spiced, somewhat overcooked, and not very fresh. It wasn't going bad, but it wasn't as super-fresh as anyone should reasonably expect at a fine dining restaurant. It was swimming in a creole tomato sauce more suited to a hospital cafeteria or school lunchroom than to a fine dining restaurant. Even the rice seemed cheap and slightly overcooked. We reluctantly ate it and left. 
Never again.",Positive

RfLSeu3dhXQjm72R_xEq1w,2015-09-08,dntv1ZMnCcG8LfxvxzCgeA,4,Well I keep coming back and not one improvement on customer comfort. The A/C is not working! When we asked they replied that the landlord told them if they got a liquor license then he would fix the air but did not hold his part of the agreement. But the owners are capable of picking up the phone and renting a spot cooler-portable air conditioner and the smoke alarm what gives knock that fu!#!#! Thing off of the ceiling. Chirping over and over. I think this is some type of experiment to see how long you can take eating some of the best food in St. Louis in the most unbearable conditions. I would probably eat there every other day if it was enjoyable. BUT BE WARNED. It is hot inside. I was kind of dissapointed on Labor day I took a friend to experience the food and I think the chef/owner took off for the holiday and the food wasn't up to the normal wonderful standard. I was also upset that they didn't have any avacado bites its like a crab rangoon with avacado spicy filling YUM!  They are sooo good! I think we are going to take a short vacation untill they move in the new location with air conditioning I hope.,Positive

Firefly is not a big place, does not have a big bar area, but serves delicious drinks and delicious foods.  I felt like I was in a high end neighborhood bar and I was treated like I was a regular.

The drinks were great.  I started simply with a Jameson and Ginger, did wine with dinner and had a special tequila drink that is specially made for a regular, but not on the menu.

The pasta of the day was outstanding.  It was in a rich, but not too rich tomato based sauce with chicken, shrimp and eggplant.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.

So what's a guy from Hollywood doing reviewing steaks and pizzas?  I grew up here!  Every time I come back to visit the folks, I spend the entire week eating nothing but pizza and steaks.  And strombolis, hoagies, scrapple, Panzarottis...  I gain 10 pounds.  They think I'm nuts.

Not like going down the pond chasin' bluegills and tommycods. This burger, swallow you whole. Little shakin', little tenderizin', an' down you go. And we gotta do it quick, that'll bring back your tourists, put all your businesses on a payin' basis. But it's not gonna be pleasant.

I have an admission to make.

You know how everyone has a movie they can quote from beginning to end? For me, Jaws is that movie. There is nothing about that movie that I don't love with all my heart. One of these days I really ought to make it to Jaws Fest, a yearly event that takes place at Martha's Vineyard, where the movie was filmed. With all that in mind, realize that there's no way I could conceive of giving a burger joint with a Jaws theme anything less than five stars.

Honestly, I think they've earned the rating even after I remove my fanboy glasses. The food is just plain good. Not good for you but great tasting. Everything on their menu sounds delicious. With names like ""frenzy burger"" and the like, you really can't go wrong. Another really cool aspect is that the restaurant holds movie nights. They'll show a shark film or other cult favorite and you can watch on one of their several TVs while you scarf. That's really going above and beyond what's expected of a burger place.

The decor is spot on. There is Jaws and other shark memorabilia adorning every wall and surface along with a large fish tank featuring a hand full of ""iridescent sharks"" which is really a sort of catfish. There's even a large hammerhead bust over the door with a burger in its mouth and glass of coke in its fin.

A word of advice: You're going to need a bigger mouth. ;-)",Positive

I've even eaten here 15 mins before close and no shortcuts were taken still consistent which is a big deal for me. I appreciate the family owned businesses opposed to chain restaurants as well.

Property and Decore: 
The outside is awful, parking lot torn out and neighboring business is boarded up. The inside though is the old familiar warm and homey architecture. Diisplay case in the middle of the dining area full length mural interesting architecture , ceiling beams etc. Comfortable booths.

Service:
Seated immediately, coffee kept being refilled, server Carol kept me taken care of and never felt ignored even though it was busy.

Food:
Had steak and eggs w/hash browns and wheat toast (and of course the coffee). The steak was a huge thick cut. You go to other places and you get a nasty piece of meat you have to chew 50 times or choke to death (can anyone say IHOP?). In short, the food was great.

Price:

At the corner of Rosemont and Speedway is a sign in the middle of a parking lot, seemingly attached to nothing. After parking,  there is a signless building, with no windows..., .that is The Bambi Bar.   Opening the door, as your eyes adjust to the darkness, comes your first smiling greeting from the bars staff.  Fantastic..... the warm welcome makes you feel right at home.   Next the swift service and the bowl of free munchies make you feel even better.   The bar has a pool table, juke box at reasonable prices, a pinball machine, and if that's not enough, a claw machine to win stuffed animals to take home to your loved one when you over stay and get home late.   Drink prices are awesome, and there is free food for happy hour.  The bar tenders are very friendly, interactive,  and most importantly always watching to see if you need anything.  All in all a great experience.   Oh did I mention the eclectic mix of regulars?   Not to be missed.",Positive

 Evidently strict measurements on everything have destroyed what used to be a great pizza.
I got 10 pizza's for a party and found out the hardway. It was like a white pizza compared to the old Hungry Howies style. And there were 3 slices of pepporoni per slice so I guess that is better than 2 per slice at LIttle C.

I am told it is the company's policy to measure everything to a strict standard set by the top.

I don't know but I think they need to adjust their policy. Lost me as a longtime fan. I always loved HH.  :`(

5Qs_FGbBq1d3T-REXwrSCw,2017-11-20,bljDenvPVEifIwO4syXQrQ,1,"I visited here at 11PM on a Friday, and explained what I wanted, which was a penguin, and some text. It was my 37th tattoo, so I'm definitely no newbie to what a tattoo costs.

I don't have any complaints about the quality of the tattoo, because it's well done. It's what I asked for. However, I was quoted $200, which I thought was a bit pricey. However, I realized that since it was late on a Friday, they probably just wanted to go home. I'll call this the ""walking in the door late tax"". Fine. 

The entire session took 35 minutes, since it was a simple cartoon from the internet, and simple text. There wasn't much in the way of line drawing. I was in and out of the shop in an hour, and for tattoos of similar size, I have never paid more than $170.

At the end of the session, when it was time to pay, the guy at the counter said $300. That was odd, because we started at $200. I'm not the type of make a big deal out of it, because that's not my style. They also asked me to get cash from the ATM next door, which cost me two fees, since the max ATM limit there is $200. (They clearly have a way to process credit cards, but chose to take cash. Fine, I get it. Report less to the IRS. I don't care.)

There are plenty of great tattoo shops in Nashville, and honestly -- I should have just gone to Kustom Thrills, since it's literally a block away, and I have experience with them. I just chose to be lazy, which I now regret. If you want to overpay, or be price-gouged for your tattoos, this is the spot for you.

I won't complain about the quality. It's a good tattoo. I just don't appreciate being jacked around on the price. What a terrible way to do business.",Neutral

 I was planing to purchase a car from the dealership. First they claimed that they do not have any maintenance paperwork for the car and could not get it. Then I forced them to call previous dealership and find it. Instead of providing an official document, they wrote an email to me with a very short description of the work done by the other dealership. They promised to send me description of the maintenance they have done on official letterhead, they have never done that. In correspondence with the sales person, Andrew Douglas, he completely ignored my questions about the car and I was forced to remind him to provide me with answers. At the end of the day, when he once again stated that the description of the car on autotrader.ca is correct, I asked him to send me the photos of the wood features in the car that were clearly not present in the interior. Instead I get an email within 5 minutes of mine:  Hello ,   I am sorry that your lack of faith has prevented you from moving forward. I sold this car to someone from Calgary yesterday.

So every month when the pension check comes in, a small group of us meet for dinner.  Tonight it was the Green Parrot in Newtown Pa.  I made reservations for 630 pm. And was seated immediately.  Even though it has a newer look on the outside, the inside is wood, brick and very cozy.  The lounge is a sports bar  with plenty of seating and TV's.  There is a patio area where construction has 10' by 6' openings with a roof that gives the outdoor feeling.  Then there is an inside restaraunt area with old time decor.  For tonight's visit I ordered the oven fired pub steak which is a 16oz Ribeye done medium rare.  Our waitress was very nice and the meal was presented correctly.  The steak had nice seasoning with a beautiful texture.  The Caesar salad was cold and fresh.  For desert I enjoyed a sweet Bailey's bread pudding.  All in all the meal, atmosphere and Staff were just right.  The total bill for 3 of us with one desert and plenty of alcohol was $162.  I expected same due to alcohol.  My steak was $28.99 which i thought was a little on the high side but its a Newtown price.  After eating at some high end restaraunts the taste was not at that level therefore only 4 stars.

cC8PZ_FhQNnMm2YCYyOA1A,2019-08-22,w5VAs_hvoTprDV2OYxAy3g,2,"I stayed at this Hilton for the first of many business trips to St. Louis. I usually opt for another larger brand but stayed at this location because another co worker already had made his reservations here. The check in was easy and they looked up my Hilton Honors account that I hadn't used in a long time. The big disappointment came when I got to my first room. I have several allergies, one of which is dust. When I walked into my room it was everywhere. The door trims, above the light switch plates, the fire sprinklers, light fixtures, both air vents were caked with dust. 

I called the front desk and they were nice enough to run me up keys to another room. It was less dusty but far from what I would consider reasonable, with or without allergies. 

Some other comments that make me concerned about the level of cleanliness that can't be seen by the naked eye:

No fitted sheets
Visible residue on the bathroom vanity, it looks like it was wiped with a dirty towel. 
Stains on furniture
""Note pad"" was 1 3""X3"" sheet of paper with dirty stains on the back. 
Hilton information card is dirty and stained. 
A random non Hilton pen was left on the counter, with a Hilton pen. 
Floor and wall trims are falling off
Smoke stained ceiling above the smoke detector. 
The shower drained very slow 3-4 minutes of shower resulted in 4""+ deep water. (It's gross because you have no idea if the tub is even clean)

I stayed in the West tower and it's pretty rough. The east tower is newer, but my coworker is texting me now at 10:40 at night because maintenance is replacing his dust caked air conditioner because it's leaking water all over the floor. 

I considered 2 stars, but the fact that this room is costing me $200/night after taxes and fees it's not going to happen.

UPDATE: I was moved to the nicer East tower and given some Hilton Honors Points. The new room is much better than the last. +1 star.",Neutral

I said id like a pedicure please. I stood there about a minute and another person sitting yelled out for me to please sign in. There wasn't a pen so I looked around and found one and signed in. A child about 9 years old said lets go. He filled the bowl and the water was chilly. I explained it was not pleasant and they asked him to use a pitcher and he removed some water and put more chilly water in. I started to leave because this is supposed to be a nice experience not a rude cold stressful experience. Another lady said it's ok he will help you..meaning the little man who finally did my oedi. He handed me a card to pick what I wanted. I deleted the 40.00 package without nails needing done. I wanted the skin and calluses done. He didn't understand his own package and 3/other people told him what it was. It was rough, fast, and I was done before the ladies that started before me and my feet still had the callouses and dry skin. They speak their language and giggle a lot. I would not suggest this place as a place to go for a real pedicure. That was just awful at any cost. I wanted to bill them for making feel uncomfortable and not doing their job correctly, being rushed, and wasting my time.

We were sat next to a large party in a corner which did not bother us at first until our server seemed to forget about us the entire time. Our plates were never cleared and drinks never refilled despite our  frequent requests. We ordered and the steak came out burnt almost black. Our server cut it and attempted to serve it on our plates but dropped it onto the plate sending hot butter everywhere. when we told the manager we were not happy with the steak he said it probably just got to close to the flame and he could not do anything about it. For 30 minutes we then tried to wave down our waitress to get the check as we were frustrated. I reached out to the company hoping to get an explanation an did not even receive a response. This place is a mess definitely will not be back. When your paying 200 bill I would hope the company or managers would care about their customers satisfaction a little more.,Positive

Coming from San Francisco, I had Mama-esque expectations (See Mama's on Stockton) and I have to say Goldy's comes close.

There were so many things on the menu I wanted to try (always a good sign) but I ended up going with the biscuits and gravy with a side of Goldy's potatoes, which I was looking forward to the most - I mean c'mon anytime you name a dish after your restaurant, it better be good.

Overall the meal and service was great (very prompt with the coffee refills, even at 11:00 am).  I am deducting one star though because my biscuits and gravy were close to room temperature when it came out.  It wasn't bad enough to make me want to send it back (to get microwaved and redelivered) but enough to disappoint me.

I wanted the massage to be a little more detailed. For a professional massage, I wanted a little more time spent on my entire body instead of my back. I feel like he spent half my 60 minute massage on my back alone.. maybe more time on my legs and feet would be nice. I also requested deep pressure but I think he felt uncomfortable considering I'm pregnant.. I just  wanted a deep pressure massage but overall, they have nice first customer deals. Def give them a try!

I'm writing my review mainly for the dog park. Unfortunately, the dog park is ALL sand. Understandably, sand is cheap and the upkeep is simple. There are balls and toys there that dogs can play with that other owners have left behind. Sometimes there are plastic bags for owners to clean up their dogs' mess with, but when there aren't any bags, there are shovels and pans to use. There is also fresh water for the dogs - owners just have to empty the provided buckets and fill it from the faucet. There isn't too much in the way of shade.

No open tables in the bar so we sat in a little comfy waist high booth kind table.  It was too small for dinner but a great size for cocktails and an appetizer.  Our waiter, Nick, asked us if we would be having dinner, gave us menus and then quickly offered that a 4 top bar dining table in his section was coming availabe asap (great touch Nick!).  We were quickly seated and offered a choice of water and ordered a couple of nice Chardonnays (there were very good).

Nick went over the menu starting with Beef and giving the typical ""why are beef is so good speel"" blah blah blah.  We were there for seafood and quite honesty I didn't come to ""Ocean Prime"" for beef---duh.  At a fine dining restaurant I was expecting Seafood first and at least a question if we were in the mood for Beef.  I digress.

I asked for several recommendations and several were offered.  We opted to pass on salads and appetizers due to alacarte veggy and potato which we beleived to be of two person size.  The $34 seabass was very large and just OK.  I tasted a fair amount of seasoning on a barely or just cooked enough piece of fish.  I wasnt impressed for the most expensive fish on the menu.  The presentation was awesome however.

I chose Snapper and it was very good.

Nick suggested the Truffle Mac and Japeno Au Gratin potatoes.  Both were very good and perfect for two people.  No desert.

The bar decor and atmosphere was very cool and everything you'd expect from a fine dining restaurant:  A.  We saw a dry ice cocktail that was really cool with the fog rolling off of it---great idea!

And now the bad.  FOR ME, the guy playing the piano and singing was way too loud and he came off like a cruise ship entertainer waiting for his big break.  We were sitting the farthest away from this music and it was still way too loud.  The music at Sullivans is way better---you can have a good conversation at your table without speaking loudly and still here the tunes.  The music for me pulled a 4 star experience to a 3.  I would suggest passing on the bar if your seeking a wonderful romantic date.  The bar was of bar volume but really cool as a restaurant bar goes.

Hopefully the Billy Joel wanna be singer dude was a temporary.  If he was the house musican I would definitely pass on the bar next time and insist on the dining room.

Leaving the restuarant was probably my best experience as the GM approached me and asked ""What other restaurants did you consider in additional to Ocean Prime?"".  Since I'm a marketing guy this scored huge points for me.  His question made me think and ultimately I realized that we patronized Ocean Prime because it was perceived to be the best SeaFood restaurant if you drove from the Geist area (or at least the best fine dining seafood that I could think of).

Summary:  Great place.  Music too loud.  Should of had more SeaFood menu options IMO.  They are missing out on a niche which is great seafood as I think there are no other options in the Keystone or Castleton area.  I'll be back but it won't be next weekend or in the next few months.

I went there again with a friend...TRY THE SCALLOPS if you dig seafood.  For an appetizer, I had the caramelized melon and Serrano ham.  I'm a HUGE fan of charcuterie and fall instantly in love with well presented cured meat appetizers.

Everything is very organized and as tidy as can be in a shop that is basically drowning in every possible style of clothing for women, including shoes and accessories, as well as a sizable collection for men. The prices can't be beat, especially here; they seem to be extremely particular in choosing pieces to purchase for inventory. Every article of clothing I inspected looked to be in fairly new if not GENTLY used, whereas most OTHER locations I have visited tend to buy just about anything to fill their racks. Staff were very friendly and helpful, even waiting patiently 15 minutes after closing time (apologies again, if any member of staff sees this!!) as I finished trying on my choices and also patiently waiting when I had to run next door to break my $100 bill, which they understandably do not accept as many counterfeits seem to be popping up lately. I used my 20% off stamp coupon with no problem, and they also gave me a new stamp card punched accordingly with the money I spent, which I am very grateful for. I will definitely be returning soon and recommending to anyone in this area. My only complaint would be that the Vera Bradley duffle bag I purchased still has a sensor tag on it (which somehow didn't set the alarm off?), so I have to return earlier than I would normally have in order to have it removed. Bottom line--excellent prices, exemplary pricing, and enormous, high-quality selection! Definitely recommend!!",Positive

Yeah, right...she probably still had it in her book. She said it 'd take 10 minutes. We asked for a manager and I could tell by her reaction that she wasn't going to send one. We waited 15 more minutes and finally gave up. We were seated at 7:30 and left at 8:55 with no food.  On our way out we let the hostess know our experience and she informed us the manager was standing close by. We explained to him and his response was if we wanted anything to go...really?!?

The menu seems too limited for me to feel like I neeeeed to go there. BUT with saying that, it wasn't too bad.

It was very clean and tidy inside, nice seating areas with lots of light. The food is like a piece of artwork when it comes out that you don't want to eat it or mess it up. I like that about it. We started our meals off with..

2 appetizers:
GREEN ONION PANCAKE ROLL and now that I come to think of it I can not for the life of me think of the second one. But I thought this one was fantastic. I recommend.

Entree
SAFFRON RISOTTO CAKES - this is what I ordered and I enjoyed it. It was a little strange to me. I didn't really know what half the vegetables were on my plate but it wasn't too bad. I have never had risotto cakes like that and I really liked those. 
We all ordered 4 different things and I think everyone was pretty satisfied with their meals.

Dessert
Peanut butter and jelly french toast is a MUST HAVE. Don't let anyone tell you to get anything but this because it was amazing. It was such a cool dessert and I wish I could eat one right now. This was my favorite part of Sprig & Vine.


The only real con is the time it took to have our food. It does take a lot longer than it should but we were having good conversation so it wasn't as noticeable to me, but looking at the clock we were there for at least 2 hours. I am more of a simple entree eater so the choices were very limited for me, I had to come out of my shell for this place but it never hurts to try something new.

It's well-lit, has new machines, clean locker rooms, and great group classes. Everyone that I have interacted with has been friendly and helpful, from the front dest staff to the janitorial team. 

This gym is 24 hours, and the parking outside is well-lit, so you can feel safe walking in at all hours. I have not worked with any of their personal trainers, but the zumba and spinning instructors are helpful and encouraging. 

A few tips to get the most of your experience:
I don't recommend going on Mondays and Tuesdays between 5-8pm because that is when it seems to be the most crowded. I've never had trouble getting an elliptical/cardio equipment, but parking and waiting for free weights during this time can be frustrating. 

My only qualm is that many users do not wipe down the machines after use. This does not seem to be an issue with cardio equipment where there are sanitary stations at the ends of rows. However, this is not the fault of Club Fitness and I couldn't knock off a star. Just be sure to wipe down your machines before and after use to be safe!",Positive

They just moved back to the ""new""/revamped location, which is nice, they even had an open house to let you wander all through it (which is always encouraging since that IMHO tends to mean that they have less to hide). The only negative I can really say about this place is the parking, there are a couple spots out front that can be tough to get in and out of and the one way side access to the small lot in the back can be tricky on a weekend.

I originally zeroed in on Muriel's Jackson Square because they offer a gluten-free menu, but everything about this place is truly AMAZING and exceeded all of my expectations ... outstanding food, amazing wine, impeccable service, memorable ambiance.

Food that is not to be missed: The Muriel's House Salad, which was tossed to perfection in a pomegranate vinaigrette. I loved how the dressing on this salad felt ""just right"". Not too little, not too much. The Wood Grilled Tournedos of Beef were so tender you could cut them with a butter knife.  This dish was served served with a twice-baked Yukon gold potato, asparagus and a creamy Bearnaise sauce that was beyond yummy. I never wanted this dish to end! The BF had a tomoato, avocado and feta cheese salad marinated in a champagne dressing to start and loved his entree of pan seared veal, jumbo lump crab meat and mashed potatoes. We split a slice of Muriel's flourless chocolate cake for dessert, which was absolutely decadent. This dish came with fresh berries and chocolate sauce and was not only incredibly rich but also freakishly good.

We also split a bottle of Pinot Noir, the 2009 Quail Ridge from Napa, which was outstanding.  Great flavor but also super smooth.  This wine really left an impression on me. I've had plenty of Pinot in my day, but this bottle was GOOD.

Moreoever, the service at Muriel's was as near to perfection as the food and drink. Our server (I believe her name was Jess) was the consummate professional. She was friendly, personable, and efficient, and even re-arranged the items on our table when we asked her to take a picture of us at dinner to create the perfect little scene.  Just another added touch that goes to show that Muriel's aims to please!  And they certainly succeed.

Finally, the restaurant itself is in a great location and in an old building that has lots of historical charm with modern touches. The decor is really neat, too, and very different throughout the restaurant.  Even though we had dinner at 7:30 on a Friday night, the place was busy but not jam-packed, which aided in the quiet, romantic atmosphere that was definitely worthy of a special occassion.

Since leaving New Orleans, I've thought about Muriel's more times than is probably healthy. But only because Muriel's offers the full experience of fine dining and they do it oh so well!  Our dinner at Muriel's was not only the best meal we had in Nola, it was also, hands down, the best meal I've had in a long time.

What I ate: Royal Cruise for 2

I came here with my best friend for a stress reliever and I had a groupon for 1/2 off. We ordered the Royal Cruise for 2 and it came with a dragon roll, spicy tuna roll, 10 pieces of sashimi, 10 pieces of nigiri (Yellowtail, Tuna, Salmon, Red Snapper). The presentation was AMAZING. Every dish has some kind of eye appeal as it can come with light up cubes, bonzai plants or flowers. It's a good place if you want to make all your instagram friends jealous. Other than their presentation, I guess the taste of their sushi is OK. I'm really picky with my sushi so I wasn't really impressed when tasting it. The flaw with their amazing presentations is that your food can take a while to get to your table.

P8X2NUCEQm-YPTS3em1Kgg,2016-08-20,W2i35VvtuKnmH2D9ychYxQ,2,"Took a boat to Egmont Key from Ft. Desoto, first thing was the reservation process.  Spoke to a gentleman at Hubbards, he explained that it was $20 per person, which is very reasonable, he explained that we needed to pay for the trip by credit card and that if we wanted to snorkel, we would have to pay cash for that on the boat and that we needed to be there approximately 40-50 minutes early to ensure we could rent the snorkel gear as there was only enough snorkel for 20 people and it was first come first served.  When we arrived to Ft Desoto, the reservation person acknowledged our reservation then told us we had to pay $100 cash and that the credit card number we gave to gentleman at Hubbards was just to hold the reservation, that wasn't what the gentleman at Hubbards had told us.  We also arrived early to ensure we would be able to snorkel, the person at Ft Desoto told us since we were going in the first boat, we were guaranteed a snorkel spot.  Ok, so things weren't as described but all in all it was fine.  We got on the boat, and found out that we could use our credit card for anything on the boat including snorkeling, again, not a big deal, just more misinformation.  The last thing was the boat crew.  The captain really wasn't a very nice guy, very sarcastic, very condescending towards a few of the passengers, the first mate was better but still not as nice as I would expect them to be.  They provide a service to the public, therefore they should be a little nicer towards the public who is paying to be entertained.  Anyhow, all was fine, it was a beautiful day.

The atmosphere was fine. Very typical for the intimate dinner with your partner, or a fun round of drinks with friends. Dim lighting, pleasant music, etc.

Drinks: we ordered four different ones. They were too strong. I know that sounds crazy, but there is such a thing as pouring too much liquor into cocktails. Flavors were ok, but nothing imaginative. And the menu- come ON. Those are not descriptions. They are clever little quips with absolutely no information in them.

On to dinner. Husband ordered the KFC after the raving reviews. I got the kale gnocchi. The chicken in the KFC was very VERY dry. Fast food would have been better. Flavor was just ok. The gnocchi itself was fine, but the sauce was LITERALLY BUTTER. Like, I feel like they melted down 3 sticks of butter and claimed that was the sauce. Neither of us could eat more than a few bites, of course tying to get our moneys worth. We ordered the poutine for an appetizer too. It was the best thing we ate all night.  It still wasn't very good. Not for what I would expect from a restaurant of this supposed caliber.

Strangely enough, I have actually have only been here when it is gloomy outside.  The Fountain is like that cozy place that go to and forget about what's going on everywhere else.  With the dim lights and all that Art Deco happening all around you, you can't help but succumb to the atmosphere.  Relax and only talk and think about awesome happy things.  

Now, their menu is daunting to say the least  - the thing is huge!  There are so many specialty drinks and amusing descriptions that you kinda just read it all for fun - though I could be the only one who does this.  I read the whole thing every time I am here, but I never stray from the same order. 

The Royal Grille with a St. Louis City Salad.  The Royal Grille is adult grilled cheese at it's finest; it is almost good enough to make me turn my nose at a regular grilled cheese.  It's pretty intense.  Oh, the St. Louis City Salad.  It's. Amazing.  No, really.  I promise.  I absolutely despise Dijon.  Hate it.  I have no clue what in the world The Fountain did to make a Dijon vinaigrette that this girl craves like it is some sort of crack.  Seriously I dream about this salad, it's that good.

I cannot say much about the ice cream martinis.  I know myself - ice cream and alcohol is not a combination that I should be making.  However, trade ice cream for sorbet and game on.  The Red Heart is my favorite, and though it is only on the menu seasonally, the super awesome waitress I had last told me I could for sure get it anytime of the year.  Yay!

The deal provided free parking and several vouchers for museum tickets and restaurants-- perfect for those visiting Philly for a weekend trip! 

Our experience at the Loews was exceptional, and we had a great time. The hotel was modern and updated, and the room was absolutely beautiful. We had a wonderful view of the city too! Customer service at the Loews went above and beyond my expectations. From the day we arrived, they were very warm and welcoming. Even when I accidentally left some items behind in the room, they shipped them free of charge back to me without delay! 

I also enjoyed the fitness center which was spacious and equipped with Peloton bikes, weights, and all the equipment you would need for a good workout.

I also learned that something that sets Synergy apart is that they are accessible 24/7 which is wonderful especially because of the sensitive nature of their work, and all of their care givers drive so they will always be prompt.

They do have some rules a little excessive in my opinion,  but hey- they're all about the safety; cant be mad at that. As long as you're safe and willing to follow the rules, you'll have a good time. 

Some of the clientele was a little snobby thou. The guy next to me with a single shot 22 was constantly complaining about ""all the brass"" from my rifle. I guess no one should have a 30 rounder, And yes my rifle spits brass far. It's a gun range dude, stop your crying. He tried to puff his little chest... really? At a place where everyone is armed? You want to start a argument? That tells me all I need to k ow about you. So- watch out for these types of folks here; haven't ran into this at any other range, was odd. A couple other people seemed put off by another guy with a Kalashnikov... again; public gun range people, stop crying. 
The range its self was very clean and alot of staff. Made it a little easier to keep watch over my family shooting with the officials watching everyone to make sure no one was getting crazy/dangerous. 

I would easily say if you know how standard firearm safety, the right kind of safety, how to correctly handle a firearm, and you're familiar with basic range rules, it wont be to big of a stretch for you here. Its WAY closer than any other outdoor range for me, unless you count wildcat type... not for me anymore.",Positive

I normally do research or check out the website prior to going to places but today, I just went with the flow! There was a Friday night early dinner crowd so we weren't able to be seated at table but we sat at the bar which was more than fine. 

Let's start with the lay out - very open and the day we went it was such a nice day out so the there was tons of natural lighting. Tons of space, didn't feel like I was over top or intruding anyone else's space. 

Now down to ordering/service, things started a little rocky at first. The first waitress gave us our menus, and provided us with water while we looked over the menu. Then all of a sudden, she ghosted us like a bad tinder date!! I felt like she asked everyone else around us if they needed anything but never asked us. That was a little strange but whatever. Another waiter at the bar came over to check on us and took our order right away. Team work makes the dream work..right!

It all worked out in the end because my date was so pleased with the service of our new waiter. Once he allowed her to swap out regular fries for chick pea fries it was game set match!

I was pleasantly surprised with the food, both her and I didn't have anything remaining on our plates and sampled from each other's as well. The lamb was so tender and moist but the salad was delicious! Lol. The drinks were tasty, Ian rather basic (Jack and Ginger) but my date loves a good handcrafted signature cocktail. Our waiter actually created one for her with cucumber, tequila and other ingredients I am not prohibited to share on the internet and she loved it. 

This place was amazing and I will be back to try some other dishes off the menu! Great job to the staff!",Positive
C4lTPbrpAZlpCdpbDeNlNA,2022-01-12,QZCBn_4dDcYjtaN7uqsyjQ,3,"Beach city is an apartment complex that gives many mixed emotions. To start off I will say--location is amazing, it's a 2 minute walk from the beach, direct walk to SBCC campus, 1 mile from state street, its really easy to meet new people and make friends, and most apartments get an ocean view. However, there are some fundamental issues with the how they run this place. For starters, there are about 50 parking spots at Beach City that aren't allowed to be occupied. There's parking spots in the garages under the apartments, behind the yellow building, and even around 15 in the green street. With a waiting list of over 100 people wanting a parking spot, you'd think they'd fill these spots. However, around 10 of these spots are occupied by the owners luxury cars--why does he store these in a college apartment complex and not his own house? Couldn't tell ya. It's times like these where my roommates without a spot have to walk 7 minutes down Cliff drive in the dark coming home from work when you really think ""gee, I know that walk is a threat to your safety, you could get harassed by the homeless or strange men again tonight, but hey, at least Mr. Beach City gets to take up 10 spaces to show off his Porsche and vintage cars! What a great use of space:)"". We are here to go to college, find jobs, and support ourselves. We need to be able to park our cars on the property!!! As well, maintenance is a joke. My neighbors have had a hole in their ceiling with pipes exposed above their sink for 3.5 months, no fixing planned any time soon. When my apartment had an ant problem, some guy in a wife beater and jeans walked in with a can of $3 Raid, sprayed our windows, and called it a day. You'd think with all the money they collect by charging $50 fines for hanging a wetsuit to dry on your balcony could cover some decent maintenance. Beach city also does not hesitate to fine it's residents. My roommate for instance left her bike on our balcony for 30 minutes while she was out getting a bike lock. During this time each of us received a $50 fine for storage issues... that's a $250 total fee for leaving a bike out for 30 minutes. As well, they've racked up some big money changing each individual of the apartments $50+ because of people having other things on their balconies like ""too big"" PLANTS, tables, and even surf boards. These fees, the parking, and the reliability to get things fixed here are horrible. Do with this review as you will.",Positive

I didn't know there are now multiple locations, but I shouldn't be surprised.  The artistry with the desserts is impeccable!  A friend from NYC told me that if there is a place like this, the average dessert would be at least $15-20 easily.  Prices are reasonable for what you get.  This is a good place to go for drinks- tea or coffee or other, or dessert.  I didn't know this place sold baguettes in some places, but I wouldn't recommend this place for baguettes in particular as one reviewer said they are expensive.

_K55hcGdYUiR79Hhd-nmRg,2013-02-22,lLE9v9rNcciAi6QxAUSWzw,4,"It's the middle of winter term and my students need a little relief from routine. It's time to temper Descartes mind-body dichotomy with a little out-of-school camaraderie: an inexpensive lunch.  Of course, we could do pizza or hoagies but there is nothing binding in them. Passing along Greenfield Avenue I see the sign in the window of what used to be ""Khajuraho"" now called ""Bombay Grill,"" ""Weekday Buffet: $8.95.""  What could be better, a Wawa hoagie and drink will bring you close to that price.  Bombay Grill is offering a sit-down buffet. The choice is obvious.  We arrived just after noon. The restaurant was still a bit empty. The staff attended to us immediately and most courteously. Most of the selections were rather standard, Tikka Masala, tandoori, fried vegetables, cocoanut rice, creamed spinach, chick peas: nothing new or exotic.  But that's not why we were here. Bombay Grill was the perfect place for a very inexpensive and very filling mid-day table where we could enjoy the food and each other's company. The students thoroughly enjoyed not just their break from class but a wonderful and simple Indian lunch.  I would also note that one of our company was Indian and she assured us that the food was indeed authentic.  She was also an invaluable guide on how to negotiate our way.  I would also note that by the time we were leaving, the restaurant had filled up with a good number of folks who just wanted to enjoy a slow and delightful lunch at a more than reasonable price.  With tax and a 10% trip (buffet service) the bill came to $11 each.  I have not yet eaten at Bombay Grill in the evening. The dinner menu is far more extensive and specialized. It is also a good deal more expensive. But for lunch, Bombay Grill weekday buffet is certainly a wonderful treat.",Positive

We encountered two main complaints, and one minor one. The minor one was the cost. After we left, we felt it just wasn't worth the price we paid to get in...but you can say that about a lot of stuff these days, especially in a touristy area like Clearwater.

The first big complaint was the facility size to guest number ratio. This place isn't set up for crowds, not by a long shot. We went on a weekday, during school, etc and still could barely get around. The walkways are all very narrow, stairways are narrow and a bit steep in some places, and the viewing areas don't have much room to work with. I can't imagine what it would be like during the summer or if a school group was there. And because of the small viewing areas and number of people, it was really hard to hear the woman giving the pelican presentation. She told people before she started to please keep quiet, but it didn't do much good.

Our second issue (I won't say 'complaint' because that's not a fair definition) was that this place is just heartbreaking. I guess I expected a rehab facility to be uplifting? Have stories and animals that were rescued and helped and lived good lives after that? The few animals that were there to see (3 dolphins, about 5 turtles, 2 sharks, and 3 otters) are permanent residents, meaning they are incapable of living in the wild. They all have something seriously wrong with them. Watching the paralyzed turtle bob up and down in a tiny, dirty tank killed me. And then watching the little paralyzed otter pull himself around on the sand...I cried. An adult woman. In public.

I understand the point of this place is helping the animals and educating the public on how big of impact we have on them, and how we can stop being so detrimental and more thoughtful. I just didn't think it was going to be so painful, so that's something you should be aware of going in for sure. You will not feel good or touched. I heard a lot of little kids asking 'Mommy, what's wrong with him? Daddy why isn't he swimming right?"" So, if you're coming with little ones, be prepared to answer that sort of thing.

Also, I'm sure Winter and her movie have done A LOT for this facility, but I felt too much of the focus was on her, and the other animals were just sort of there. I'm sure she's also the cause of the overcrowding, as I don't think the facility was prepare for the demand of a ""celebrity"". Everyone was pretty much there to see her, which in turn made it pretty hard to actually *see* her. 

If you know going in that this place is small and depressing, maybe you will have a better opinion of it.

I will say, the employee in the back room ""education area"" was wonderful. We and another small group were looking at the tanks with the seahorses and such, and he was just a wealth of knowledge. I actually learned a few new seahorse facts!

*We parked easily. Got to pet the sting rays with the room pretty much to ourselves during the male dolphin's show. Can't comment on food prices because we didn't eat. Didn't go to Winter's Tale across town.",Positive

5U6M5mdJ4CMUefBpsIrcSw,2015-09-09,AFLID_qyrrbEepehgVvbSg,3,"I have been to Sentinel Peak Brewing twice, my visits have been about a year apart. 

Good things have happened at Sentinel Peak in the last year. They are expanding in size, adding more tables to sit at. They are also adding a patio which is nice. They are now offering a greater variety of drinks, including coffee drinks, wine, and hard cider. 

On my first visit I just had beer, a sampler flight, sitting at the bar. Nothing particularly stood out. I did like the live music and I like their location. 

Because my first visit was just ok, it took me a while to come back. I bought a Groupon and decided to give them another try. 

This time I ordered a pint and food. I was surprised to see some of the same beers from last year mixed in with a few new ones. This time I got their regular IPA. It was fine. However, we really liked the food we ordered. We had the carnitas tacos and I would recommend them. I also had the buffalo chicken sandwich. It had a nice amount of shredded chicken, buffalo sauce, and blue cheese. The food was really very good. We asked to have the sandwich split and that wasn't a problem. 

Our server on our second visit was excellent. We sat at a table. We noticed a large family group coming in to celebrate a birthday. It looked like a nice place for a group to get together. 

Overall, I am glad this new business is doing so well. I would recommend them for meal or happy hour get together. However, the beer isn't my favorite, but I would still recommend giving it a try.",Positive

After seeing this place had all 5 star reviews, I decided it was finally time to try it out since I only live around the corner. The guy at the front was really cool and helped me pick out a pizza based on what I like (spicy and delicious). I ordered a half Bombay Masala and a half Spicy Paneer. It was a 10-15 min wait but it was well worth it knowing the pizza was being made fresh to order. My first bite was incredible, so many spices and flavors that I had no idea could be put into a pizza. The Bombay Masala is your typical cheese pizza but infused with Indian spices. It is in no way overwhelming like some Indian food can be, just really tasty. The Spicy Paneer had small cubes of Paneer (type of Indian cheese) on it and had just the right amount of kick. Not only was my 10'' pie awesome, it was only $7! If you're looking for something new and you like pizza, you HAVE to check this place out.",Positive

I came in to have lunch on a Sunday around 2-3pm. Our server seemed nice but hardly checked up on us. I had to ask 2 other servers at different times for things because mine was no where to be found. It wasn't even busy!! I saw her standing near the bar a few times. Just hanging out. 
Then we got our food. I had asked the server if my food was a good dish (the SB Roll) she said yes. It was not. Not very much flavor at all and was definitely not worth the price! :(
I was very frustrated by the whole experience..
Also my daughter's  drink was $3.50 for a 8oz drink..are you kidding me??

Some advice I have is--- Management needs to step up their game and tell their servers to PAY attention to their customers. It's not hard...I was a server for 5-6 years. Come on!

rpFT0AX5kqMdtbdNH-gvdA,2009-07-10,PiWCtYaaIhG869M6TazkCg,4,"I've read plenty about theories of neo-stone age colonization of North America by Pacific Islanders. Those crazy cats sailed dugout canoes across the mighty pacific (which, to be fair, was a few feet narrower back then) using the stars as their guide. A couple dozen thousand years later, their great, great, great grandkids invented Mexican food, and their forefathers invented Thai food. More recently, somebody figured it'd be a good idea to mix them.

That person was correct.

Enter Nitallys, at heart a Thai restaurant with all the standards, plus bubble tea and tasty, tasty smoothies, but ultimately a new experience in fusion cooking. 

I spent a few minutes before writing this trying to figure out a fun way to combine the words 'thai' and 'mexican,' (thaixican, mexithai, mai, thex). Luckily, Nit and Ally, the proprietors, had better luck working with the food. Tacos, Burritos, and Mole from our side of the ocean combine with curries, basil, and fried rice from out east, and the results are consistently great.

Tried a Yellow Curry Burrito and the Chicken Panang Mole, washed down with Thai Iced Tea and Iced Tamarindo. The burritos (double fisted in a single order) were presented well, even in a to-go box, with a toss of cilantro. If you can imagine spicy chocolate mixed with curry, and only if you can imagine it being amazing, then that's what the mole chicken tasted like.

A side note: I was specifically directed by the girl I was with to go in the bathroom (alone) and turn off the light. Very relaxing, you should check it out.",Positive

Instead, stand-alone coffee shops like Still Perkin' (a former PJ's franchise) offer expertly crafted espresso and cold drip coffee beverages (it's where a machiatto is still a machiatto and not a milkshake for the overly caffienated). They make, arguably, the best iced coffee in town and always have a variety of fresh brewed iced teas available (both black and herbal), so crucial in our semi tropical climate.
    Finally, Still Perkin' is still buyin' marvelous baked goods from a number of local purveyors instead of squeezing their treats from Sysco tubes.

NM3jP-98xUThy9Ji_lBDdw,2012-09-24,AaJ9d4OrFmgc4S_U2QiSZg,4,"Sorry to read all of the so-so reviews for this place. I've been several times, and have never had any significant complaints. I've tried Carrabba's, Olive Garden, and Macaroni Grill; and have found Romano's Macaroni Grill to the best of the three in terms of chain restaurants serving Italian fare.

This particular location is found at the intersection of Ehrlich Road and Dale Mabry in northern Carrollwood. I generally sit at the bar, or in the bar area, and have found the service in this area to be much better than the standard table service. The manager hangs out in the bar area, and she generally circulates past everyone to say Hi and ask about the food & service.

My server tonight was the bartender, Amanda, and let me say right up front that she was spot-on despite a busy dinner rush and many, many drink orders. She gave me some great suggestions regarding my food choices, and pairing them with a delicious glass of wine, and them constantly checked in to be sure that everything was to my liking.

I started with the Caprese Salad which was a nice mix of sliced, colorful vine-ripened tomatoes, freshly mozzarella, basil, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and a drizzle of the really good, barrel-aged balsamic vinegar. The thick and sweet good stuff! That came with Romano's classic warm loaf of bread served with olive oil and fresh cracked black pepper.

For my main course I skipped my usual Penne Rustica, and ordered Shrimp Portfonio which was prepared with jumbo shrimp, cannelloni, spinach, mushrooms, pine nuts, and lemon butter. Very delicious!

Now here is where Amanda really showed her stuff... I wanted a glass of wine to pair with my dinner. My first thought was a Pinot Grigio since the light white wine usually has a crisp, refreshing taste. Amanda suggested that I instead order a Chilean Chardonnay called Emelina Nature Unoaked Organic. This wine was far superior to what I had planned as it had more of a buttery flavor and was missing all of the heavy oak aftertastes that normally come with a Chardonnay.

I was really impressed by her knowledge of wine and she told me that she is studying to become a master sommelier -- in other words, a highly-skilled wine steward. The lady really knows her stuff, and her outstanding attention to service plus her extremely pleasant personality made my meal a big hit.

For those who are planning to visit this Macaroni Grill, try sitting in the bar area and checking to see if Amanda is working. Well worth your time!",Positive

First, the service was great, and the food came quickly.  (Barbeque is one of the few foods that you want to have prepared ahead of time.)

Second, I love the decor.  I am a big fan of reused industrial buildings, and Smoke Factory obviously put some effort into doing this nicely, both inside and out.

So my major gripe with barbeque places in general is the lack of healthy, low carb sides.  I was happy to see they had ""seasonal vegetables"" listed.  So l ask the server what was the ""seasonal vegetable"", expecting corn or maybe broccoli.  Surprise, the reply was ""grilled asparagus""!!!   So I ordered that and a pile of pulled pork.  

I was expecting 4 or 5 skinny stalks.  Nope.  It was a pile.  A big pile.  Like more than a half a pound!  And, it was properly cooked, and covered with butter.  (Note: I said ""low carb"", not ""low calorie"".  If you want low calorie, don't go to a 'Q place.)

Pork was good. Tried the House, Sweet, and Mustard sauces.  Truly couldn't pick a favorite - they were all tasty.

As soon as we got there we were greeted by a fairly new employee named KB and as soon as he saw my pin that said it was my birthday he was super nice and warm and friendly and made us feel so welcome and even though he didn't know us he treated us like family. My birthday experience got significantly better when we discovered that our server would be my favorite server, Lauren. I met her about 9 months ago on my first visit to the restaurant and she gave us amazing service and treated me like family as well as anybody else I've ever brought to this restaurant.

Now, honestly, I was a bit nervous because - being from Louisiana - my experience has been that any time I have sampled attempts at Cajun cooking outside of Louisiana I have been invariably disappointed. 

Not. This. Time. Finally! Someone who can do Louisiana style cooking - and do it well! For an appetizer we had Artichoke Hearts, flash fried. Crispy and delicious. For mains we split two dishes - the Jambalaya Sauce Piquante and the Fusilli Roasted Sweet Italian Sausage. Both were quite tasty with a variety of flavors coming through simultaneously. A good portion size as well leaving you enough room for dessert! Accordingly, we were compelled to give the bread puddings a try and were well rewarded - the whiskey sauce, in particular made the dish for me. The only thing I would change - is the cornbread.

A majority of the stories seem rushed and littered with spelling and grammatical errors.  In other cases, there's a lot of wire copy and material taken from press releases with little to no effort to dig beneath the headline.  I suppose a lot of this can be attributed to the loss of key personnel over the years due to corporate cutbacks and a decline in readership.

It has gotten so bad, the Statesman has had to collaborate with the crosstown rival just to stay afloat!

This is very sad considering that the only alternative is to turn on the television, where the news quality is mediocre at best - the overall objective has leaned dramatically towards the delivery of entertainment instead of information.

We didn't think much of this initial interaction until we notice and inconsistent after being seated that others where immediately acknowledged/tended to. After sitting for a little we felt rushed as the waitress, a woman with a dirty outside coat under her apron with no hair guards/net kept coming to the table to ask if we were ready to order  We ordered a good amount of food & everything came in a reasonable amount of time. I noticed there was a fine black curly hair atop one of my tacos, being hungry I took everything that touched it off & disregarded speaking up about it, which I now regret . My man & I always tip appropriately, keeping in mind the overall service & not just how good the food was. We split everything in half, rounded everything to the next dollar & left the same tip as well all on cards . As we took our time to get up & leave I waited for the usual restaurant exit greetings & none of the staff near the door even said have a nice day or come again soon . Besides being completely disgusted by the racial profiling we received I am escalating my concerns because few days later I checked my credit card statement to see whomever input the tip included in an extra tip on my end, I then called my fiancé to make sure he was charged correctly & they had done the same thing to his card . As if being African American in America isn't hard enough daily but for someone to not only feel they don't have to deliver quality service to paying customers & then attempt to steal my money on top is a complete and utterly tragic & I am concerned we aren't the only ones they've done this to, just the first to notice & not be scared to escalate our concerns.",Negative

Although their menu is relatively small, they do every dish great and does not lose to the other good places for Thai food in Santa Barbara / Goleta. TAP has the best ambiance to enjoy a sit down meal but can be the toughest to park for as it does not have a dedicated lot.

On to the food, my favorites are the PCU Noodles and the Drunken Noodles, depending on mood. The sides/appetizers don't have the biggest portions, but the calamari, shrimp rolls, and roti are still worth it in my opinion.

I've been introducing new ppl to this place for 3 years now, not to mention going there myself at every opportunity. I live in jersey and I still make the drive out there at least 3 times a month to satisfy my craving for their Cajun chicken sandwich. During the day, I have no problem stopping in with the kids to grab lunch, but I love when they dim the lights, raise the volume on the juke box, and I can hang out with my hubby and friends (after 8pm). We can usually eat a fantastic meal for about as much as we'd spend eating at Wendy's. Obviously there's more expensive options, I just happen to be head over heels in love with a particular plate. :) Please give this place a shot. You'll be glad you did.

We grabbed a seat at the oyster bar and were immediately greeted with two freshly shucked raw oysters. I've enjoyed plenty of oysters from both coasts at a wide variety of establishments both throughout my life as well as in New Orleans specifically and the raw oysters we ordered here were by far the largest I've ever had. More sweet than briny, they were amazing! I also loved the delicate, smoky flavor of the chargrilled oysters. My husband ordered an oyster po'boy while I grabbed half a shrimp po' boy and a cup of crawfish etouffee. Both orders were excellent, with mine being the clear winner in my opinion. Loved that they offered a few combo options for people like me with limited time in the city and limited space in the tummy. The po' boys were all I hoped for and more, but that etouffee was a revelation! Washed it all down with two expertly crafted bloody marys, decked out with raw oysters and poached shrimp.

HAAX0dISoK7SqilT74zC8A,2016-10-06,vHc-UrI9yfL_pnnc6nJtyQ,3,"My first experience at F&D was definitely the honeymoon phase. I was blinded by the bliss of finding everything under one roof at amazing prices other stores couldn't touch, so we ordered everything we thought we needed for our home remodel, and thanks to the warehouse storage option, they held onto it all until we were ready.  

We hemmed and hawed on various elements of our design choice, and their sample policy (buy it and bring it back) made checking out various options real simple. We ended up moving forward with the AquaGuard laminate flooring, the most expensive laminate in the store, and returning the travertine (which thus far I have not seen credited back to me).

By examining samples at different price points and handling various materials, it quickly became apparent that these great prices come at a serious cost in the quality department. Affordable Travertine, $2-$4/sq foot, which is naturally variable in color, was on the extreme end of the variability scale and contained a lot of filler. The budget travertine was made up of mostly filler. In order to get quality and moderate consistency you had to step up to the premium stone at $6-$7+/ square foot, which is no different than buying from one of our awesome locally owned tile stores.  

The real kicker was the AquaGuard laminate, which we attempted to install. We watched the video, which made it look simple, but as we went through the process, the locking tabs that connect each piece literally DELAMINATED, shearing off cleanly, creating excessive waste and demonstrating the low quality of this product. We couldn't even get a single row down without this issue. While other laminates use an mdf material to create their foundation, this was some type of papery composite, and looking at some of the sample pieces we even noticed chunks missing just from being moved in and out of a car. 

Bottom line, it's all going back, and beyond a place to gather a few ideas and maybe picking up underlayment, baseboard etc, I really can't recommend this store.

Solid customer service can only take a company so far, and that's why I left this at three stars. There are pros to their return policy as well, and if you're on an extreme budget, you can find products that will get the job done.

F&D is a store for some folks, but as someone looking to seriously upgrade my home, I can't really recommend it.

Working with Chrys is like working with a good friend (well, a good friend who is amazing when it comes to fabulous food and planning skills!).  We have used Chrys for work receptions - sometimes for 50 people, sometimes for 100 people, sometimes for 400 people.  Each and every time he has come through with awesome menus and food that is just wonderful.  And if we run into a problem -- whether it's with linens, flowers, last minute changes, etc. -- he is right there to save the day.  I need to emphasize how delicious the food is -- and how helpful, friendly and good-at-what-they do the staff is.  And the dessert trays -- omg, so amazing!  I always pray that we'll have fewer people than expected so the staff will get leftovers.  Speaking of leftovers, Chrys and the staff always pack anything that's left and put it away for us.  When I explain what my budget is, Chrys is very conscientious about keeping the cost exactly where we need it to be without ever skimping on quality and attention to detail.  Do yourself a favor and call Chef's Table for your next event.  You will be very happy.  (And get yourself that European dessert tray -- you will be happier still!)  p.s. If you ever need a special cake (not just for work - but personally)  that will almost make people swoon, talk to Chrys about the black and white cake.

I have fair skin with pink undertones and came in requesting ash blonde peekaboo highlights.  The reason I specifically requested ash blonde is because I know that with my coloring, warm colors such as gold or caramel would not look good on me.  I came in with many pictures and examples because I knew that with the specificity of what I was requesting, there was very little room for error.   

I really liked the way that Katie placed the highlights, but the color is a warm caramel-y blonde and did not look good with my skin tone.  Additionally, Katie wasn't very friendly and aside from offering me a few magazines and giving me the salon's wifi password, she didn't really go out of her way to make me feel welcome.  She told me that I was ""thinking about it too much"" when I asked questions about what the color would look like and how it would complement my skin tone.  Changing your hair color is a major decision and to me, that's something that warrants a lot of thinking.

The place is known for a rotating menu but some items are famous and standard. We started off the dinner with a soothing ginger infused tea, and also a honey tea in lemon grass. Both were amazing. We then had the kimchi spring rolls which is beyond heavenly. The Thai peanut sauce that it comes with is extremely fantastic. Also had the cheese board which was fantastic except for the mozzarella cheese that had a weird consistency. In the main course, the pad thai and roasted broccoli sub are just mind blowing. The lentil walnut burger is also great, unfortunately they had run out of the bun and so used bread pieces instead which made the burger fall into pieces and hard to hold, but still extremely delicious. The dessert at least for me was a disappointment. They had run out of their cheesecakes which was unfortunate for us. We had a avocado tart that had a strong avocado taste that I couldn't enjoy, and a brownie which was ok. Both were raw, so this is a place where many items are raw and they have managed to play so well with the flavors that the experience is refreshing, tasty and unique.

Came here for the first Eagles game of the season, and it was packed. Pretty much your run-of-the-mill sports bar, with a decent amount of seating and a decent beer selection. TVs everywhere. So why the 'meh' review, you might ask?

The service was slow and spotty, which is understandable considering how many people were there for the game, buuuuut... kinda seems like the kind of place that should be used to crowds/should have figured out how to deal by now.

Secondly, the food menu is oddly diverse, but I couldn't bring myself to try any food since the girls that we met there said they had just seen a mouse scurry across the floor moments prior to our arrival. I get it, we're in a city, these things happen, but still. I'll pass.

Now the food. The food...was..amazing. First, we had the mussels and clams. I wasn't expecting to enjoy them, as I'm typically not a fan of red sauce. I was wrong. The sauce has a smoky rich flavor that inspired us to soak up every last drop with our soft, fresh bread. 
The lobster bisque was just as good, which I understand is made with the same tomato base. It was served with a scallop and caviar as garish. I will go back to this restaurant for the bisque alone!! Perfection.
Our steak was done perfectly. It was flavorful and tender. 
Over all, I highly recommend you try this steakhouse. Be prepared to pay a pretty penny, but it's worth it!",Positive

Before my visit, I got a tad skeptical looking at their prices. The prices on the website are for ""Level 1"" and with a stylist on a higher level, your service can cost more. Well, after seeing my stylist was level 3, my mind ran all over the place. Am I going to be paying $60 for a haircut? I also wanted a color consult which would have been $25. 
Heather cut my hair, and she is great. She gave me exactly what I've been wanting and cheaper salons haven't been able to provide. we talked about color (I'll be getting it done next week) and explained exactly what the process would be. 
at check out, my total was only $46 (when I was expecting 40 bucks more) She said she usually doesn't charge for a color consult when a client gets a cut because you're talking anyways. I truly appreciated that! And the extra $10 for her being ""higher level"" is well worth it. So I'm estimating each level is about $5-$10 more.

I was told the package would be delivered by 5:30pm. 7:00pm rolls around, and still no package. I was then told it would DEFINITELY be delivered the next day.

Next day comes, and from 6:00am until 4:32pm the package was supposedly on the truck and out for delivery. At 4:32pm the tracking updates and says that the receiver (myself) called and rescheduled delivery!

Time to visit in person! I ask for a supervisor at the center, tell him everything that's happened the past three days, and he begins looking into it.

The people behind the counter were friendly, but there were no menus at the takeout area, only milkshake menus. We found our own menu at the host/ess area. By the time we figured out what to order there was 15 people that had walked in and crowded the counter in front of us. We waited patiently, but there was a loud buzzing alarm that continued on the whole time brr brr brr very annoying, worse than the guy that came in I overhead say over and over, ""we need a table for six, two adults, two children"" So a table for four?

Fries are a la carte, order them separate.

The parking lot is a death trap.

We ordered and the server was friendly. When we got our food I knew we needed a few things like ketchup. I love ketchup so I asked for a handful of packets when our food was ready because I knew the large fries would require large amount of ketchup, we only got 5 packets (1.6 oz, that's half the quantity I can get through the TSA at the airport). I got the chili cheeseburger and it was not worth $6, I didn't know I had to ask for Fried or raw onions, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickles, relish, barbeque sauce, hot sauce. The burger was literally bun-burger-cheese-burger-cheese-bun with chili all squished to the outside around the burger except for a piece of a red onion the size of my burger under the top bun hard as a rock. This onion piece was obviously the outer layer and not meant for consumption. The beans in the chili were huge, look at your thumb nail, they were twice that size. The chili was all squished out the sides despite our careful handling. Tough to enjoy.

Both shakes were bad. I asked server which shake had more mint because I wanted mint in my milkshake. She said a lot of people order the mint oreo, but she liked the think mint shake. I opted for thin mint because thin mint cookies takes better than oreos (instead get Wegman's brand oreos, your foundation will be shaken). The shake was made with chocolate ice cream and there was hardly any mint in it at all. My wife got mocha and it was a vanilla shake. I don't like coffee so I'm very sensitive to it. When I don't taste coffee in it theres no coffee taste. She said next time she'll have to get coffee flavor, surprise, there's no next time if you're reading this Caitlin.

I don't like Nifty Fifty's and I don't think I'll be back.

She asked me a series of questions before the service began. I personally like a more firm/deep massage. She did just that. I was perfect.

Things I noticed during the service that made this 50 mins blissful was the hot towels she used during the service. The room was also almost pitch black. For some reason I kind of loved it! It really makes you relax.

My husband and I got in line for dinner here at 8 pm and were not seated until well after 10 pm. The employees did not have any regard for the people waiting hours in line. There was loud commotion the entire time, with people heckling us etc. NO FOOD is worth standing 2 hours in swamp weather with sore feet, needing to use bathroom, etc. 

Once we finally got inside, things got even worse. I went to use the restroom and it was dirty; I saw a waitress in the restroom and informed her that there was no toilet paper. She shrugged and did nothing. I had to tell other ladies in line to use paper towels because the staff wouldn't refill the toilet paper. 

We ordered entrees and waited another hour for them- I think we finally got dinner at 11pm. My $18 ""taste of New Orleans"" included lukewarm gumbo, cold crawfish etouffee, and slightly tolerable jambalaya. My husband's $16 shrimp po boy was stale and the fries obviously microwaved. The entire meal had the taste and texture of something that had been hastily microwaved.

Take it from me and don't come here, especially if there is a line. Not worth it in the least, I wasted $50 and feel awful about it. The place is a mess, service was spotty, there was no element of hospitality, etc. 

My biggest advice if you're going our to the French Quarter/Vieux Carre in the evening: either eat beforehand in a different neighborhood or secure reservations beforehand (go to Arnauds, Felix's or Antoines instead of this place!!)

With all the restaurant choices in Metairie, we tend to forget about Outback.  Back on point, the meal starts off with their complimentary warm wheat bread, which was followed by the free bloomin' onion.  With the guilt over all those carbs,  I followed that up with Cobb salad for my dinner.  My wife ordered the Queensland Chicken & Shrimp Pasta.  Most of her pasta came home for lunch today.  We finished the meal off with the Smores cookie dessert.  Our service from Amber was exceptional, much better than the usual expectations from a chain restaurant.",Positive

We love it and go as often as we can. I know of no other place in Philly where you can get such an impressive range of meat-free Mexican food. Also it's a great place to take a family of omnivores, since everyone can have what they want.

I've been a long-time dedicated fan of Sabrina's Cafe at Powelton. I was disappointed that my first time stopping this particular one couple months ago ended with disappointment when I was told the wait was 1 hour. 

If you want to skip my extended review, here's the only thing I want you to take away: a little secret - they don't take reservations, but they do take call ahead seating. TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THIS! This allowed me to reduce my wait down to 5 minutes, and everything worked so smoothly without us needing to wait. Otherwise, expect to wait 45+ min!

FOOD: 5/5

Alice Cooper's ""School's Out For Summer""  Breakfast Special: Quite the proper description for me, given that school's out for summer! I loved the banana bread french toast. To be honest, I spent most of my time picking for my parents, so I didn't really read the description of what I ordered other than its awesome name. The banana bread was quite the surprise. The sweetness of the bread and maple gravy definitely stood out among the savory and salty egg scramble, but it was the perfect balance. The portions were huge!

G. Love's ""Rhyme for the Summertime"" Egg White Omelette: My mom is quite health conscious after discovering that her cholestrol level was a bit too high a couple years ago. I recommended this since it was all egg white. I'm personally all about the egg yolk, but this was well prepared. The omelette was so tender, and the marscapone cheese was a great addition!

Sublime's ""Doin' Time (Summertime)"" Mexi Special: Hailing from Southern California, my dad absolutely loves anything that has a ""Mexi""-style attached to it, especially when it comes with avocado. The food itself was a bit too messy for my liking. Everything seemed to be a mountain piled on top of fried tortilla bread, so that was a bit difficult, and thus disappointing, to eat. The avocado tasted fresh, and rice was well seasoned. 

SERVICE: 5/5

As mentioned above, take full advantage of the call-ahead seating! I promise that you'll come in happier. The waiter we had was super friendly and helpful. She helped clarify all the questions I had, allowed me to have the rice to be served on the side (Dad doesn't like onions which was in the rice), and made sure the egg white omelette my mom had didn't get messed up because it was golden yellow on the outside. My only negative feedback wasn't from this one experience, but the time before. When I was told the wait was going to be 1+ hour, I was treated quite poorly and felt like I was being pushed out the door. I'm glad that wasn't the case this time.

Overall, this place is my favorite brunch place in Philadelphia! If you're too full from the huge serving, take a nice stroll along the Parkway, and consider enjoying all the wonderful attractions around - Barne's Foundation, the Basilica, Rodin Museum, Philadelphia Art Museum, City Hall, Love Park and Schuylkill River!",Positive

I had been visiting the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial & the Gateway Arch.  Wanting to grab a bite to eat before hopping on the MetroLink to head back to Scott AFB, I walked a short block past the train station to discover Hannegan's.

My waitress was one of the few employees selected to work that day.  I believe she was working a double shift.  A little ditzy perhaps, but not troubling at all.  Her service was off a bit, but still adequate.

I ordered a mixed drink and their barbeque sampler platter.  The meat was smoked to perfection.  I found all of the food provided to be of excellent taste and a good deal for my money.

They have amazing quality everything! The items you buy from this bakery will be more expensive than elsewhere but absolutely nothing can compare to the quality of food you will get from Bee Bell Bakery. It is worth every single penny! 

My only complaint about Bee Bell is that they don't have long enough hours. I would love to be able to have the option of grabbing a muffin or a scone from Bee Bell on a Sunday afternoon but they are closed Sundays. It breaks my heart. No really, it does.

In an effort to expand our knowledge of Indiana history, four of us decided last Saturday was the day we wanted to stop. 

The tour starts in the barn turned gift shop in the back. We each paid our $10 admission to get in (cheaper if you have a AAA membership or Student ID -- make sure you have your card with you) and were escorted around to the front., Our guides met us at the door and welcomed us into the house for a tour through the place and a history lesson. Our guides each had different areas of expertise; one was an architect and the other a historian. The other group that came in after us only had one guide and I'm sure they didn't leave knowing as much about the place as we did. We were lucky.

Walking through the house, we learned what moved Harrison to Indiana from the Cincy area, saw the spot where he accepted the Republic nomination, saw his military order signed by Abraham Lincoln, and even the bed where he passed away. Many items in the house are original, and the items that aren't have been carefully matched to what was there originally.

Here's some ""pro tips"" from someone who has gone there for a while. 

First: Completely ignore the crappy attitude of the front desk staff. They're psychopathic and not your problem. Do not engage. 

Next: If you find someone you like.. STICK with them. Call the Chop Shop that day and find out if that person is there. For me, I like Bob. Bob has a very set schedule (as of this writing he is not there on Tues and Thurs.) Okay then. 

Don't go to some random person one time and expect an awesome cut. The SECRET to this place is simple: Get ""close"" with someone then go back every time and get the same cut.

We had to have someone walk into the bar to tell someone we had arrived.  They said, ""We know, we are getting your table ready."" So apparently they saw us arrive, they just didn't think it was worth walking up and saying hello. The ambiance was weird. Very loud, even in the private dining area we had. The decor and internal walls seemed like an afterthought, the music playing was something I'd imagine hearing at a Forever 21 store.  Just didn't fit hearing Bananarama in the background.  The wait staff was slow and unresponsive. I had the Filet Mignon with Blue Cheese crusted top.  The blue cheese spread was so salty that's all I tasted.  No cheese, no steak, just salt.

I ended up ordering chicken and waffles because I had the most amazing memories of chicken and waffles in North Carolina. My friend ordered the The Doc Holiday sandwich, which has a coffee-rubbed Ribeye cooked to temperature w/sauteed Portabella mushrooms & onions, served on a French baguette. 

The waitress was friendly and our food came out quickly. My chicken and waffles had 2 big fluffy waffles that filled the entire plate, 2 cups of syrup on the side, and 4 fried chicken wings. Because my previous experience with chicken and waffles was with a panko-crumb fried chicken breast, I was a bit surprised to see the chicken wings, but the wings were quite good nonetheless--crispy, though slightly bland. Fried chicken + waffle + syrup = delicious though with the combined textures and flavors. Overall, my chicken and waffles were ok, but not as amazing as the ones I've had in the South! 

My friend really enjoyed her ribeye sandwich, which was big enough that she had a big half leftover after she felt full. We both lamented later that we should have tried some more of the classic creole/cajun items on the menu: the shrimp and grits, the po boy, or the jambalaya! We'll have to come back and try those!

Everything looks fresh and tastes good, they do a high volume business on their nachos/burrito assembly line and work through a lot of orders fairly quickly.  I was very pleased with the Monster steak burrito and veggie nachos, probably because I got to pick item by item what went into it.

First of all, I have to mention that it was VERY annoying to have to wait 20 minutes (yes, 20!!!!!) even after having made a reservation weeks in advance.  Seriously, people without reservations were seated much more quickly than we were .  We were about 5 seconds away from making a scene when we were finally seated.

Fortunately, our very nice waiter, Brian made up for our poor lobby experience.  The service was very attentive and accommodating.  We got 5 plates of the fried bananas, which are in several people's opinion, the best part of the meal.  YUMMY!!!!!  The rest of the food was very decent as well.  We tried (by our accounting) all 15 types of meats on the menu.  My personal favorites were the lamb chops and leg of lamb (no trend here hahaha ).  Some other favorites were the frank steak, chicken wrapped in bacon and ribs.

The ""salad"" bar was very good as well.  We enjoyed that everything was labeled so that we knew what we were eating.  This is all compared to Picanha, the other Brazilian steakhouse that we've been to.  Picanha has the reputation of being more authentic and a better bang for the buck.  Nothing I have seen discredits this.  Although there is a lot to be said for the cleanliness and the clarity of the menu and the labeling of the salad bar at Chima's.

How the HELL can the PREVIEWS sound BETTER than the FEATURE FLICK?

I paid $16.25 + $1.25 = $17.50 for SUB PAR SOUND EXPERIENCE. 

This is LUDICRIOUS. It's like going to a concert and they never went about 5 when max volume is 10. How many people would go if they knew it was just doing to be loud enough to hear but not enjoy themselves w/ full sound immersion as one desires?

On top of that, the beers went up to $8.50 for 20oz and $10.50 for 32oz. I can buy 24 beers at Costco for $21 dollars. I think they were $6 and $8 last time. 

I think I will stick to home, where my SOUND is BETTER than the Theater and my SCREEN is Satisfactorily Large. I can also pop Organic Popcorn and Butter, and I don't have to share an arm rest. I can drink 21 1/4 more beers for double my money too ($10.50 x 2 = $21).

We ordered the TUC Fries which were great! Tasty to the last bite. I watched as he interacted with his other table and he gave them the same unwelcomed service. What really shocked me was when a heavy set man walked passed the bar and this judgmental prick gave this man a disgusted long stare. It was so obvious to our table that he was judging this man because of his weight. I couldn't believe my eyes. That incident made us feel so uncomfortable to witness.

I'm not sure how long they have been there, but they had to of been there sometime after August 2020. That was the last time I was in town getting a cheesesteak. Putting a dessert place in the heart of the cheesesteak world was a brilliant deal. For a while I would walk a store or two near Ginos steaks and get a cannoli and some Italian cookies. 

Turns out this location has a created lab? Not sure what that is all about. We did not stay long enough to find out all the details. But, to just get cookies we walked into the far right door.

We had to repeat so many times our order because the staff in the back was too loud and messing around in the back. The male who was helping I felt bad because of all the noise. He could not even focus. That's one reason I gave a 4/5. The other because of the old cookie my husband received. 

In the end, would we go back... yes. But, so will also still get someone Italian cookies down the street too.",Positive

The chips are hot and salty and the little triad of salsas is so yummy that I want to simply beer bong the tomatillo and get it over with. The service is great...I've always just been embarrassed to ask for giant tubs of each one to save the servers the hassle of multiple salsa refill visits. 

The carne asada is wonderful, machaca burrito juicy and packin a little kick, and the bean and rice are appropriately lardy and creamy, respectively. On our last visit I wasn't even hungry, and still managed to pack in an entire chicken taco plate (about $7) leaving nothing for the dishwasher to scrape. 

Lil Mex is always packed on the weekends, but tables turn over quick and I've never waited more than a couple of minutes, no matter big our party.",Positive

We waited for our food about 15 min because they couldn't get our order correct due to providing us the wrong ticket. We asked for dipping sauces that weren't given to us, and by the time we got our food it was cold of so much back and forth.",Neutral

You walk into what looks like a library, and you must put your name down for entrance. We had a short wait, maybe 10 min. The ambience is very dark, dim lit. Huge bar, bookstands all around to keep the library feel. Theres also booths as well. They keep the place filled but not packed, however it was very loud. 

I wish i could remember which drinks we got, cause damn they were perfect! I know for sure both had vanilla in them lol. The bartenders really care about their craft and make every drink with love. Each drink was uniquely delicious. We would return!",Positive

GeVVmfyDXJk3PfS4UwaFPQ,2014-09-05,gXImJoYiK1tVQQFownvDOg,5,"Loved this salon! I had purchased a groupon here with Mandy which is how I heard about this place... obviously I checked the reviews and they were all great so I had to try it... that and I desperately needed a haircut! I was able to make an appointment easily, Mandy fit me in within 48 hours of me calling which was great! I arrived a little early and Mandy was getting ready, but saw me right on time for my appointment! She was so sweet, and actually listened to what I said I wanted done and did just that! I was very pleased with the outcome of my hair, and left feeling like a model after she styled it up! I will definitely be coming back to Mandy for all my future haircuts in town!

As far as the salon, it's small and cute. There are about 6-8 different chairs. There were a few other stylists there as well and all seemed very nice. They have a couch waiting area in case you bring someone with you. There is parking on the side and the back of the building as well!",Positive
RCvzFRJoc4RZPwUSey1MeA,2020-09-12,6HqlZQ2lK15mf1WxjqEHiA,4,"Found this place by searching Italian restaurants on Open Table. Made a good choice by going with this restaurant. I gave 3 out of 4 stars because we made reservations and still had to sit and wait for 15 minutes. Also when we ordered our entrees, we order a pizza to go for when we finished our meals and the waiter forgot about it, so we had to wait another 15 minutes. Understanding his mistake we still left him a 20.00 tip due to the COVID hardships on the restaurant businesses.

NOW... me and the beautiful wifey LOVED the ambiance and the food that was sooo good I just wanted to dance. You know food is good when you dancing in your chair. I had the veal marsala with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I cleaned my plate and would have licked it but my beautiful wifey would have probably slapped me. The beautiful wifey ordered the chicken parmesan, she would have finished it but we scarfed down a delicious appetizer of thinly sliced wedge eggplant. It was a good experience and we will definitely be back. I would have gave the cook a hug, but that would be frowned upon because of COVID.",Positive
